      <h1>About</h1>
      <p>My name is BrittMouse! I'm a trans woman (she/it) living in the American South. I'm 24 and I have a degree in
        political science. I focused most of my time on international relations, where I learned about U.S. foreign
        policy and the study of genocide. These have impacted my worldview a great deal and I'm very happy to have taken
        them with the professors I did.</p>
      <p>I fall somewhere on the Left of the political spectrum, but frankly it's too complicated to boil down to "I'm a
        socialist." I have some pretty strong disagreements with the Chomsky Left on international affairs so it's
        rather difficult to figure out exactly where in the Left I stand. The best descriptor might be anti-fascist
        first, socialist second.</p>
      <p>I've also started going to a Jewish Reform synagogue and the people there are absolutely amazing. If I was
        religious, I'd be Jewish, hands down.</p>
      <p>I've been using Linux Mint since June 2023. I've dabbled with Arch, Debian, and Fedora, but Mint is where I'm
        most comfortable. This whole website was built using Neovim on Linux Mint and Fedora.</p>
