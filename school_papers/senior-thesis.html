      <h1>Violence and Freedoms: Three Case Studies on Interventions and
      Rights</h1>
      <p style="text-align: center;">BrittMouse</p>

      <h2>Abstract</h2>
      <p>U.S. foreign policy has been the subject of intense criticism from
      the broader left-wing of American and European politics, especially in
      the wake of U.S. support for Ukraine in the wake of the Russian invasion
      in February 2022. Much of this criticism is born out of experiences in
      Afghanistan and Iraq and leads to worse foreign policy decisions
      overall, including support for autocratic states hostile to human rights
      and the Left’s supposed goals. This article sets out to find whether
      this view is accurate to recent humanitarian interventions by the U.S.
      by analyzing three case studies and comparing the longitudinal human
      rights values of the intervened and surrounding states separately. The
      data suggests that after these interventions, rights increased
      drastically in each intervened state. While these findings do not
      justify war crimes committed during these interventions or other U.S.
      military actions, they do provide insights into the history of U.S.
      interventions and a starting point for future research into how to
      conduct interventions in the future.</p>

      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>Humanitarian interventions are perceived very differently depending
      on political bias. While the general consensus is that interventions are
      important and useful tools to relieve humanitarian disasters, the
      American and European left-wings are rather hostile towards them. For
      many leftists, this stems from an “America bad” epistemology influenced
      by domestic policy (healthcare, policing, taxes, etc.) and key foreign
      policy moments like the establishment of banana republics throughout
      Latin America, the justification of the invasion of Iraq through WMD
      claims, and continued support for Israel despite their actions towards
      the Palestinians.</p>
      <p>Worryingly, this reasoning often leads to even worse foreign policy
      stances, whether that be support for Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in
      February 2022, denying chemical weapon attacks by the government of
      Bashar al-Assad in Syria, or denying that the genocide in Srebrenica,
      Bosnia was a genocide (despite the determinations by international legal
      systems). It was these stances that led the author to ask whether the
      U.S. was as malicious with its humanitarian interventions as it was made
      out to be. This article sets out to prove that humanitarian
      interventions have a significantly positive effect on human rights and
      determine why those interventions had the positive effect they had. This
      is done in the hope of encouraging others on the Left to properly
      consider foreign policy decisions by the U.S. and other states instead
      of starting with a belief and working backwards to justify it.</p>

      <h2>Literature Review</h2>
      <h3>Intervention</h3>
      <p>A review into U.S. intervention must begin with what an intervention
      is. A humanitarian intervention is a set of actions taken by an actor to
      alleviate or end a humanitarian crisis in another state; the crisis
      could involve large market failures, famine, civil war, terrorism, or
      crimes against humanity including genocide. Humanitarian interventions
      take a variety of forms depending on the policy tools used by the
      actors. Since military force is a common form of intervention, the term
      “military humanitarian intervention” (MHI) will be used. Since the
      1990s, the U.S. has engaged in several interventions around the world,
      differing in scale, method, length, success, and stated purpose. The
      intervention in Somalia in 1992 and 1993, called “Operation Restore
      Hope,” was meant to end the ongoing civil war and ease the effects of
      the famine of 1992, and was largely done via U.S. armed forces and U.N.
      peacekeepers on the ground; in contrast, the intervention in Kosovo in
      1999 by NATO was an air bombing campaign meant to end the war and hold
      Yugoslavian and later Serbian President Milošević responsible for the
      ethnic cleansing of Kosovars.</p>
      <p>The U.S. is far from the only player on the world stage that
      intervenes in humanitarian crises; there are a number of
      non-governmental organizations, intergovernmental agencies, and other
      states that intervene in a variety of ways and for a variety of reasons.
      The U.N. hosts several agencies that intervene in humanitarian crises,
      including U.N. peacekeepers, High Commission on Refugees (UNHCR), Office
      for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA), and International
      Federation of the Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC). NGOs
      include Doctors Without Borders (MSF), advocacy agencies like Amnesty
      International and Human Rights Watch (HRW), and financial aid
      organizations like Syria Relief and Development. NATO also has a history
      of engaging in MHI, usually at the permission of the U.N. Security
      Council. While this paper deals with military humanitarian intervention,
      the actions of other intervention and aid groups have to be taken into
      account.</p>

      <h3>Paradigms</h3>
      <h4>Neoliberalism</h4>
      <p>Liberalism was borne out of the Enlightenment and the writings of
      Locke, Smith, Voltaire, and Kant; neoliberalism is a refinement of that
      theory informed by theorists of the past century, especially Keohane and
      Nye. It questions the security focus of neorealism and instead focuses
      on mutual benefits (absolute gains) and democratization as ways of
      deterring violence and addressing the anarchy of IR. It views
      intergovernmental and nongovernmental organizations (the U.N. and
      universities being an example of each) as important parts of
      understanding IR, along with international trade to tie states closer to
      each other economically and democratization to deescalate potential
      conflicts. This last part is essential to <em>democratic peace
      theory</em>, the theory that democracies do not go to war with each
      other because they have less harmful methods of engaging in conflict
      resolution.</p>
      <p>Neoliberalism emphasizes the democratizing effect of free trade among
      states and communication between states in order to solve “prisoners’
      dilemmas,'' where two parties have an incentive to cheat on each other
      to pursue greater relative gains while worsening absolute gains.
      However, international trade has not always worked to facilitate
      democratization and peace – Germany’s attempt to integrate Russia into
      the European market via the Nord Stream pipelines backfired in February
      2022 with the invasion of Ukraine. There is significant overlap between
      neoliberalism and institutionalism as described by Keohane and Martin
      (1995), so this article will treat the two as the same, despite
      Keohane’s dislike of being considered a neoliberal.</p>
      <p>Support for humanitarian intervention is generally split along
      ethical lines. Immanuel Kant, someone who believed in natural law
      (Holzgrefe, 2003), opposed interference in another state’s policy
      unilaterally, claiming that humanitarian crises “can serve as a warning,
      by means of the example of the great ills a people has brought upon
      itself through its lawlessness” (Kant, 2006, p. 70). Joseph Nye, a
      social contractarian (Holzgrefe, 2003), disagrees, saying “The American
      people clearly think that their interests include certain values and
      their promotion abroad—such as opposition to ethnic cleansing in the
      Balkans” (Nye, 1999, pp. 23-4). For those neoliberals that do support
      intervention, it is out of the belief that states have a duty to protect
      and promote the rights inherent to those living there, and that when a
      state acts antagonistically towards that duty, other states have a moral
      obligation to intervene to protect those rights (Tesón, 2003). This is
      reflected in the doctrine known as “responsibility to protect”
      (R2P).</p>

      <h4>Neorealism</h4>
      <p>As an update to the theory of realism, neorealism keeps the main
      assumptions of the international system, namely that states are the
      primary actor in IR, that the international system is anarchic, and a
      state seeks to maximize its own security / power and will do so above
      everything else. Classical realism lacks the structural system
      introduced by Kenneth Waltz, who believed that structures played the
      biggest role in determining how states pursue their security, not human
      nature as espoused by classical realism and informed by Machiavelli and
      Hobbes (Waltz, 1990). The division between security and power as the
      priority of a state is a debate within neorealist circles that has been
      ongoing for several decades. <em>Defensive realists</em>, those who see
      security as the most desirable object of the state, often look at
      “security dilemmas,” places where State A taking actions to enhance its
      own security, even ones seen as entirely defensive by State A, is seen
      as an offensive move by the states around it that requires starting
      their own defensive security initiatives. This is because states
      inherently do not trust each other and can only really trust themselves.
      Security dilemmas can end up spiraling into arms races and full conflict
      if not defused, so defensive realists favor a balance of power between
      states (Spindler, 2013). <em>Offensive realists</em>, those who see
      power as the state’s priority, favor a “great powers’ hegemon” view of
      IR, where powerful states exert a large amount of influence over states
      in their sphere of influence, including determining the foreign policy
      of those states. The offensive realist understands power as the most
      desirable object of the state, even if it makes that state less secure
      over time, and sees that striving for power as what perpetuates the
      great powers’ competition.</p>
      <p>Neorealists disagree with liberal institutionalism’s embrace of
      absolute gains over relative gains and how institutions can work to
      facilitate cooperation by punishing cheaters, thus lessening the
      suspicion states have towards each other (Mearsheimer, 1994). The
      constant risk states put themselves in by simply existing in the
      international community drives their decision-making towards security,
      whether that is obtained by military force or cooperation, although
      military force is preferred as cooperation runs the risk of cheating by
      one or multiple parties seeking to maximize relative gains. Due to
      working within a great powers’ analysis, neorealists try to avoid
      “aggressive” acts like intervention if they are within another great
      power’s sphere of influence so as to not upset the balance of powers on
      the world stage. The focus is security, not necessarily human
      well-being. An example of this line of thinking is Mearsheimer’s 2015
      lecture “Why Ukraine is the West’s Fault,” where he claims expanding
      NATO to Poland and the Baltic states forced Russia to annex Crimea.</p>

      <h4>Constructivism</h4>
      <p>Constructivism is a more recent paradigm that takes cues from
      sociological theory in considering the interests of actors as socially
      constructed instead of set in stone. The main idea of constructivism is
      that international relations are governed by norms which are subject to
      change as time moves on, reflecting both the systems of government the
      state uses to rule and social norms in domestic society. To some extent
      this is true – international relations worked differently during
      medieval Europe than they did during the Cold War; constructivists
      relate this to how the understanding of the role of government has
      changed and how IR actors have approached anarchy. Alexander Wendt’s
      1992 article “Anarchy is What States Make of It” suggests that while
      anarchy exists, how states approach anarchy varies based on norms. While
      neorealists claim that anarchy is something to protect against via
      military security and neoliberals view anarchy as something that can be
      limited by international institutions and trade, constructivists believe
      that both groups are doing so in the ways they are because of how
      anarchy is considered.</p>
      <p>Constructivism has a fair share of critics. Both neorealists and
      neoliberals believe that since constructivism is not trying to predict
      future IR events, that it is not worth taking seriously. There is also
      the truth that this paradigm is younger and significantly more
      complicated than neorealism and institutionalism, as a constructivist is
      not just taking into account states, but also ethnic diversity,
      government structure, public opinion, the ideas of those in charge, the
      role of both international institutions and NGOs and everything
      underneath them, and local and international cultural norms. As such, it
      is more suited to understanding events of the past, not predicting
      events of the future.</p>
      <p>In interventions, there are two norms inherently at odds with each
      other – state sovereignty and human rights. Other norms play into the
      broader picture, including legality, legitimacy, morality, and
      constitutionality (Dixon, 2013). Constructionists see intervention as a
      decision states make based on those norms and their interactions with
      each other, and view the aftermath of intervention as based on whether
      the norms of civil liberties rub off on the government and its
      members.</p>

      <h3>Humanitarian Crises</h3>
      <p>A humanitarian crisis is an event or series of events that severely
      threatens the rights or lives of a large group of people. These are
      distressingly common throughout the wider world and only look to be
      getting worse. Currently, UNHCR lists sixteen emergencies or situations
      on its Emergencies page: Afghanistan, Burundi, the COVID-19 pandemic,
      Central African Republic, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Central
      American displacement, Ethiopia-Tigray, Iraq, Nigeria, the Rohingya
      people, Sahel, South Sudan, the Syrian Civil War and refugee crisis, the
      2023 earthquakes that devastated Syria and Turkey, Ukraine, Venezuela,
      and the Yemeni Civil War (UNHCR, 2023). Several commonalities exist
      between them, including lack of access to food and water, mass internal
      and external displacement, and state and civil violence, whether that be
      terrorism like in Nigeria and Iraq, civil wars like Syria and
      Ethiopia-Tigray, or invasions like what Ukraine is still experiencing.
      These are all current crises, and as such are not wholly suited for a
      longitudinal study on the effects of MHI on human rights – it is simply
      too soon. Humanitarian crises, sadly, are not a new development.</p>
      <p>Looking back into the 2010s, 2000s, and 1990s, there are several
      times the U.S. has used MHI abroad, notably in Panama in 1989-1990, Iraq
      and Kuwait in 1991, Somalia in 1992 and ‘93, Haiti in ‘94 and ‘95,
      Bosnia and Herzegovina in ‘95, Kosovo in ‘98 and ‘99, and Libya in 2011.
      The invasions of Afghanistan in 2001 and Iraq in 2003 are contentious as
      to whether they count as <em>humanitarian</em> intervention (Roth, 2006;
      Connah, 2021), but I will include both regardless. During the Cold War,
      humanitarian intervention was less common, but the U.S. intervened
      heavily in Latin American elections, usually to “contain the spread of
      communism” and enforce the Roosevelt Corollary to the Monroe Doctrine
      while supporting leaders like Pinochet in Chile<sup><a href="#fn1"
      class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"
      role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a></sup> that violated human rights
      regularly (Webber, 1999). These are not humanitarian interventions and
      as such will not be considered, but it is still helpful to know about
      the history of intervention by the U.S. military as that is why many are
      skeptical of it working or being done for humanitarian reasons.</p>

      <h2>Research Design</h2>
      <p>“Have U.S. military humanitarian interventions between 1985 and 2022
      had a positive impact on human rights abroad?” The author believes they
      have, but different paradigms will give different reasons for the
      improvement. A constructivist might say “MHI has a positive effect on
      human rights because it allows the norms of liberal human rights to be
      established and perpetuated through the population,” while a neoliberal
      would contend “MHI has a positive effect on human rights because it
      leads to the establishment of domestic and international institutions
      that are able to protect human rights.” The neorealist would attribute
      it to power projection, saying “MHI has a positive effect on human
      rights because it is the exercise of hard power that allows these
      institutions and norms to perpetuate in the first place.” The author
      believes the constructivist is most correct in this case, as human
      rights can and will perpetuate themselves through norms given fertile
      soil.</p>
      <p>The hypotheses are as follows: </p>
      <p><strong>H</strong><sub><strong>1</strong></sub> – If the U.S. decides
      to launch MHI, human rights will increase significantly;</p>
      <p><strong>H</strong><sub><strong>2</strong></sub> – If MHI happens in a
      region with high levels of human rights development, rights will stay
      high after the intervention is over;</p>
      <p><strong>H</strong><sub><strong>3</strong></sub> – If MHI is supported
      by international institutions like the U.N. Security Council (U.N.S.C.),
      human rights will be higher than those without int'l support;</p>
      <p><strong>H</strong><sub><strong>4</strong></sub> – If MHI involves the
      use of foot soldiers in a primary capacity, human rights will be higher
      than if the intervention was carried out primarily via airstrikes;</p>
      <p><strong>H</strong><sub><strong>5</strong></sub> – If MHI takes longer
      than 12 months, human rights will not increase as much as if it had
      taken less time.</p>

      <h2>Methods</h2>
      <p>This article will be using case studies on interventions in
      Afghanistan (2001-2021), Bosnia and Herzegovina (1995), and Panama
      (1989-1990). Information on these case studies will be gathered from
      peer-reviewed articles, books, and government sources. Longitudinal data
      on human rights in states will be pulled from the Varieties of Democracy
      (V-Dem) Country/Year dataset for 2023 (Coppedge et al.) and analyzed
      using Microsoft Excel – the specified index is <em>v2x_civlib</em>,
      which is a composite index of three other indices in the dataset
      (freedom from physical violence, private civil liberties, and political
      civil liberties)<sup><a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"
      role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a></sup>; the researchers also include
      upper and lower bound coding so significant changes in civil liberties
      can be determined.</p>
      <p>Human rights is synonymous with civil liberties for the purposes of
      this study, using the definition in the V-Dem codebook (2023) for
      <em>v2x_civlib</em>:</p>
      <blockquote>
        <p>Civil liberty is understood as liberal freedom, where freedom is a
        property of individuals. Civil liberty is constituted by the absence of
        physical violence committed by government agents and the absence of
        constraints of private liberties and political liberties by the
        government. (p. 296)</p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>Human rights serve as both the dependent variable for intervened
      states and independent variable for nearby states taken as a mean to
      serve as a comparison to the intervened state, since this article seeks
      to test regional human rights development’s impact on long-term human
      rights development in the intervened state. The timeframe for all the
      human rights data is 1985-2022, but not all that data is necessarily
      relevant to each MHI and may be narrowed as needed; any narrowing of the
      timeframe will be specifically noted. Due to the breakup of the USSR in
      1990 and breakup of Yugoslavia in 1992, some states are only going to be
      involved in the counts after that date.</p>
      <p>International backing is an independent variable and is measured by
      whether the U.N. Security Council issued at least one resolution in
      favor of the intervention or whether the U.N.S.C. disapproved by either
      failing to issue a resolution in support of, or passing a resolution in
      opposition to, the intervention.</p>
      <p>Length of intervention here is referring to how long U.S. forces took
      to “end” the humanitarian crisis, but since that is different for each
      intervention, I will specify time frames for each: Afghanistan lasted
      from 7 October 2001 to 15 August 2021 (Operations Enduring Freedom and
      Freemon’s Sentinel); Bosnia and Herzegovina lasted from 30 August to 20
      September 1995 (Operation Deliberate Force)<sup><a href="#fn3"
      class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"
      role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a></sup>; Panama from 20 December 1989
      to 30 January 1990 (Operation Just Cause). The method of intervention is
      split into two categories – with and without boots on the ground. In the
      former, the U.S. engages in a ground invasion to intervene in the state,
      while in the latter, intervention is carried out via airstrikes and
      other methods that do not involve an invasion. This does not take into
      account peacekeepers or peace enforcement operations on the ground like
      UNISOM or UNPROFOR that are not affiliated with the U.S. The length and
      method of intervention are also independent variables.</p>

      <h2>Analysis</h2>
      <h3>Human Rights</h3>
      <p>The analysis done in Excel is rather simple: data were copied from
      the .csv dataset for the three separate MHIs and turned into separate
      charts comparing the human rights in intervened states and other states
      in the region – the other states in question will be listed in each
      exhibit. Non-intervened states had their human rights scores averaged
      together to get a sense of how developed human rights are in the region
      and to simplify the charts.</p>

      <h3>Exhibit A -- Afghanistan</h3>
      <p>Afghanistan is a state in Central Asia with a long history of
      resisting occupation even before the U.S. invasion in 2001. It was also
      one of the worst states of human rights in the world pre-2001; from 1996
      to 2000, Afghanistan had a 0.03, the worst in the region. Under the
      Taliban’s rule, sharia law is implemented, banning women from schools
      and employment and mandating head-to-toe coverings in public, and
      imposing strict criminal penalties including amputation, floggings, and
      public executions (Bloch, 2021). Both the Taliban and al-Qaeda are
      designated as terrorist groups in 1999 by the U.N. (S/RES/1373, 2001),
      due to their engagement in terrorism and support of terrorist groups
      around the world, most notably on September 11, 2001. The U.S. invoked
      Art. V of the North Atlantic Treaty and U.N.S.C adopted Resolution 1368,
      condemning the attacks. The subsequent U.S. invasion, involving
      airstrikes and many troops on the ground, overthrew the Taliban in short
      order and began the work of building a liberal democracy over the next
      two decades, an effort that collapsed after the withdrawal in 2021 and
      subsequent Taliban conquest.</p>
      <p>While the U.S. failed to build a lasting liberal democracy in
      Afghanistan, HMI substantially improved human rights in the state during
      its course. To compare these rights to those of the region, values from
      China, Iran, Kyrgyzstan, Pakistan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, and
      Uzbekistan were averaged together. The data are rather revealing – the
      U.S. occupation results in the best human rights record Afghanistan has
      seen in decades, with a high of 0.58 from 2003 to 2011, followed by a
      strong crash as soon as the U.S. withdraws.</p>
      <p><img src="./images/exhibit_a.png"
      style="width:5.6909in;height:3.5in" /></p>
      <p>At first glance, the reason for this is very simple: human rights
      were only proliferated through military force from the U.S., NATO, and
      Afghan National Security Forces (ANSF), and when that military force
      collapsed, so did the liberal regime. This is certainly a neorealist way
      of interpreting the situation, but a constructivist might see things
      differently, in that the norms of human rights were unable to
      proliferate throughout Afghanistan thoroughly due to a long history of
      the region being geopolitically isolated from liberal notions of human
      rights for centuries. A more optimistic constructivist might disagree
      with that assessment, and contend that human rights norms being
      introduced and proliferated for twenty years has given it enough time to
      settle in fertile soil and that there may yet be a renaissance.
      Neoliberalism would instead point out that institutions protecting human
      rights were dissolved after the Taliban took over, and that is what
      caused the crash. Frankly, it is just too soon to tell what the future
      of Afghanistan will be, and whether the Taliban are going to continue
      their fundamentalist policies of sharia, reform, or be overthrown by
      internal or external forces.</p>

      <h3>Exhibit B -- Bosnia And Herzegovina</h3>
      <p>Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) formed out of the Yugoslav Wars as an
      independent state for Bosniacs (Slavs that had converted to Islam
      centuries ago) that also sought to respect the rights of non-Bosniacs
      living in its borders. The borders of BiH also included large Serb and
      Croat populations, and Serbs living in BiH wanted to stay with the
      Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (later Serbia and Montenegro, simply
      Serbia). This started a war that lasted from 1992 to 1995 filled with
      crimes against humanity, war crimes, and ethnic cleansings committed on
      all sides. The worst and most numerous crimes were committed by the
      Bosnian Serbs, represented by Republika Srpska. The International
      Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia (ICTY), part of the
      International Criminal Court, convicted 52 Serbs who were part of
      Republika Srpska in connection to various breaches of international law;
      most notable were the convictions of Ratko Mladic, Radovan Karadzic, and
      Radislav Krstic on counts of genocide for their roles in the Srebrenica
      genocide, where over 8000 Bosniac men and boys were executed by the Army
      of Republika Srpska (VRS) and many Bosniac women and girls were raped
      between 11 and 13 July. Srebrenica was originally a safe zone set up by
      the U.N. peacekeeping mission U.N. Protection Force (UNPROFOR), but the
      Dutch peacekeepers stationed there were unable or unwilling to stop VRS
      from moving in.</p>
      <p>In response to the genocidal massacre and mass rapes, U.N.S.C.
      demanded that VRS withdraw from Srebrenica and another safe zone at Zepa
      (S/RES/1004, 1995). VRS refused to do so. After VRS shelled the Markale
      marketplace in Sarajevo in late August, the NATO mission enforcing a
      no-fly zone over the former Yugoslavia (Operation Deny Flight) became a
      deliberate air strike campaign against Bosnian Serb positions in an
      effort to end the ethnic wars and force all sides to come to the
      negotiating table. While there was a ground element to the operation
      consisting largely of artillery, and UNPROFOR was still in the country,
      the intervention was largely an air campaign lasting 41 days. After the
      Dayton Agreements brought an end to the Bosnian War, there has been a
      concerted effort to keep that peace through IFOR, SFOR, and national and
      international judicial systems.</p>
      <p><img src="./images/exhibit_b1.png"
      style="width:5.6909in;height:3.5in" /></p>
      <p>The states used to determine the average are Albania, Austria,
      Bulgaria, Croatia, Greece, Hungary, Italy, Kosovo, North Macedonia,
      Romania, Serbia, and Slovenia, and the time frame sits from 1985 to
      2005. Since BiH independence was born out of a war of separatism, human
      rights were low at the start, sitting at 0.36 from 1994. After MHI,
      human rights increased to 0.41 by the end of 1995 and 0.68 by 1996.
      There is another bump after the end of the Kosovo War, but human rights
      do not quite reach the average levels of states in the region. Still, it
      is clear that MHI led to a significant increase in human rights in BiH.
      The question then is why did these rights stay high after the
      intervention was over compared to Afghanistan, or more specifically, why
      mass ethnic conflict has not broken out in BiH since?</p>
      
      <p><img src="./images/exhibit_b2.png"
      style="width:5.6909in;height:3.5in" /></p>
      
      <p>A neorealist would argue that BiH, Croatia, and Serbia have not gone
      to war again because any gains from new territory or integration of
      ethnic Bosniacs, Croats, or Serbs into these respective states would be
      significantly outweighed by the cost of doing so both in terms of
      materiel and international standing. Agencies like the Organization for
      Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) and the current EU
      peacekeeping operation in BiH (EUFOR Althea) dissuade any state from
      taking publicly threatening acts against one another. The neoliberal
      disagrees, and sees the actions of ICTY, the International Court of
      Justice (ICJ), and the establishment of national judicial processes and
      human rights protections in BiH as pivotal in promoting long-term human
      rights improvement. Constructivists would disagree with both and believe
      that the high levels of human rights development in states west of the
      Iron Curtain proliferated through through former Soviet bloc states and
      has since taken root in the social consciousness, and that while there
      is still some ways to go with some post-Soviet states, it has largely
      been successful in these efforts.</p>
      <p>To test the constructivist’s view, BiH’s human rights are compared
      with those of post-Soviet states (simplified to “East” and containing
      Albania, Bulgaria, Croatia, Hungary, Kosovo, North Macedonia, Romania,
      Serbia, and Slovenia) and states west of the Iron Curtain (“West,”
      Austria, Greece, and Italy). The Western states stay at or right next to
      0.94 for the entire period (1985-2005) while BiH lags behind the
      post-Soviet states until 2000, remaining very close for the rest of the
      period of analysis. This suggests that rather than the threat of future
      military force being what promoted human rights in BiH, it was the
      embedding of human rights norms that facilitated the strengthening of
      civil liberties post-intervention.</p>

      <h3>Exhibit C -- Panama</h3>
      <p> Panama in the 1970s and 1980s was ruled by various dictators, the
      last being General Noriega, a CIA-funded drug trafficker and
      authoritarian nationalist who was the<em> de facto</em> leader from 1983
      to 1989 (Gilboa, 1995). Noriega’s arms and drug trafficking was
      overlooked for years because he was an important asset for the U.S. in
      their fight against the Sandinistas and Colombian drug traffickers like
      Pablo Escobar, but after 1985 things deteriorated. A series of crises
      frayed relations between Washington and Noriega, as domestic actors
      revealed many of Noriega’s crimes and corruption and protesters demanded
      his resignation. In 1988, he was indicted in Florida by two federal
      grand juries on fifteen counts of drug trafficking, racketeering, and
      money laundering, including helping Colombian drug traffickers move
      cocaine into the U.S. and helping American drug runners smuggle over a
      million dollars of marijuana (Gilboa). Having a key anti-trafficking
      ally in Central America be indicted on multiple drug trafficking charges
      certainly defeated the supposed purpose of the relationship, and things
      kept deteriorating.</p>
      <p>In 1989, two major events led to the decision to invade. First were
      the Panamanian general elections in May, in which Noriega’s preferred
      candidate won by a 2-to-1 margin due to election interference by the
      Panama Defense Forces (PDF). The U.S. disavowed these actions (H. Con.
      Res. 122, 1989; S. Res. 120, 1989) and President Bush Sr. established
      sanctions against the country, withdrew the ambassador to Panama in
      protest, and stationed more Armed Forces personnel in bases in Panama
      (Gilboa, 1995). Second was a failed PDF coup against Noriega in October,
      after which Noriega declared himself “maximum leader” and refused to
      bend in the face of stiff but unsupported Washington rhetoric. The U.S.
      took action in late December in Operation Just Cause, toppling Noriega’s
      government, arresting and extraditing Noriega to the U.S. for trial, and
      installing Endara—the opposition candidate in the 1989 election and
      actual winner—as president of Panama in just over a month.</p>
      <p>The invasion lacked international support and was legally
      dubious<sup><a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"
      role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a></sup>. The government cited the self
      defense of Americans in Panama and protection of the Panama Canal (in
      relation to the Torrijos-Carter treaties) as <em>casi belli</em>, but
      Bush Sr. did so without consulting Congress in what has been argued was
      a violation of the War Powers Resolution (WPR). The Organization of
      American States (OAS) passed a resolution on 22 December demanding the
      U.S. withdrawal, the U.N. General Assembly (U.N.G.A) voted 75-20 to
      condemn the invasion on 29 December, and a resolution in the U.N.S.C.
      supported by 7 states was vetoed by three permanent members: France, the
      U.K., and the U.S. (National Security and International Affairs Division
      [NSIAD], 1991). A Senate bill in 1989 included an amendment stating that
      “Congress hereby supports—[...] the President’s utilization of the full
      range of appropriate diplomatic, economic and the military options in
      the Republic of Panama” (S. 1711 § 811(b)(2), 1989), but this bill never
      passed the House of Representatives and as such that clause was not law
      at the time of the invasion. The invasion itself was largely a ground
      campaign, marked with operations from U.S. special forces groups and air
      support via attack helicopters, and lasted 42 days.</p>
      <p><img src="./images/exhibit_c1.png"
      style="width:5.6909in;height:3.5in" /></p>
      <p>Despite the intervention happening for reasons hardly related to
      human rights issues, as Noriega had been in control of the country for
      years and had received support from the U.S. for years just as with
      previous dictators, the data suggest that the intervention led to much
      greater human rights protections despite the backlash from the
      international community. Compared to the average (here taken from
      Colombia, Costa Rica, Ecuador, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, and
      Nicaragua), human rights were rather low up until the invasion and
      subsequent liberal government rule, jumping from 0.34 to 0.86 between
      1989 and 1990. The value stays high from there on, reaching a high of
      0.91 in 2000 and staying there until 2018. The region experiences a more
      gradual human rights development on average from 1985 to 2000, although
      it is not a uniform development, as Costa Rica stays in the mid 0.90s
      throughout this period and the main drivers of greater human rights are
      El Salvador and Guatemala ending their civil wars.</p>
      <p><img src="./images/exhibit_c2.png"
      style="width:5.6909in;height:3.5in" /></p>
      <p>Panama’s rapid human rights development has different explanations
      depending on the paradigm. Neorealism suggests that it was the
      post-intervention occupation by U.S. military police lasting until 1994
      that stabilized Panama. Neoliberalism contends that instead it was the
      establishment of a liberal government with strong human rights
      protections that led to the sharp increase. Meanwhile, constructivism
      would argue that there were already proliferated norms that were
      intentionally tamped down on by the military dictatorships and that once
      that was removed, it was natural for those norms to take a dominant role
      in civil society.</p>

      <h2>Discussion</h2>
      <p>Considering these case studies, the data heavily suggest that
      intervention leads to significantly higher human rights in states on the
      receiving end, meaning the data fail to disprove H<sub>1</sub>. The
      argument around H<sub>2</sub> centers on whether human rights flow out
      from an intervened state or in towards an intervened state. The data
      here are mixed. While the data reflect that human rights improved in
      line with nearby states in BiH (suggesting an inwards flow), Panama saw
      an immediate and very strong improvement that was well ahead of the rest
      of the curve in other Latin American states (suggesting an outwards
      flow). However, a reminder should be made that the human rights
      development across Latin America was <em>not</em> uniform: Costa Rica
      and Ecuador had high scores on the civil liberties index before Panama’s
      MHI, and after the intervention, Panama’s human rights index has stayed
      in line with those two states through 2022. The rest of the Latin
      American states included in that case study have stagnated around 0.75
      on average. In Panama’s case, it seems less likely that human rights
      were high primarily due to regional norms than there being a
      democratically elected president (Guillermo Endara) ready to take power
      once Noriega lost it.</p>
      <p>The intervention in Afghanistan was heavily influenced by
      nation-building goals and the hope that Afghanistan could be turned into
      a thriving liberal democracy in Central Asia, signaling a hope that
      human rights would flow outwards as a wellspring in the Central Asian
      mountains. Evidently that experiment has so far failed with the
      withdrawal of U.S. troops in 2021. The author does not believe, however,
      that the experiment is necessarily over. A state is not a time capsule,
      and those norms that did proliferate through the populace must have
      taken root in many. Time (and the actions of those in Afghanistan) will
      decide what happens next. Considering this, H<sub>2</sub> has not been
      disproven, but whether it is true is still vague.</p>
      <p>The level of international support for MHI appears to have had little
      if any impact on how human rights developed post-intervention.
      Afghanistan had wide public support and had better human rights during
      the intervention than before and after; Bosnia and Herzegovina’s
      intervention was mandated by the U.N.S.C. and facilitated a peace
      agreement between all parties, and the human rights situation has been
      positive, if behind its neighbors slightly; the invasion of Panama faced
      strong international condemnation from OAS and U.N.G.A. but was
      diplomatically supported by the U.K. and France, and it led to the end
      of the military dictatorship and reestablishment of elected government
      in Panama, making it one of the best states for human rights in Latin
      America. Since the level of international support for MHI had little to
      no impact on whether human rights improved, H<sub>3</sub> is
      disproven.</p>
      <p>The method of intervention also did not have a substantial impact on
      human rights. Bosnia was largely an air campaign, while Panama and
      Afghanistan involved ground forces. Afghanistan had roughly 100,000 U.S.
      troops at OEF’s peak in May 2011 (McInnis &amp; Feickert, 2017), and the
      International Security Assistance Force (ISAF), the NATO mission to
      Afghanistan through 2014, saw a max of roughly 130,000 troops including
      those of the U.S.; the use of military aircraft by the U.S. cannot be
      understated though, as coalition forces relied heavily on airstrikes on
      ground targets. Panama saw 25,600 U.S. troops involved in Operation Just
      Cause (NSIAD, 1991) and sorties from EF-111A electronic warfare aircraft
      and F-117 stealth strike aircraft. The intervention in BiH had no U.S.
      or NATO troops on the ground but did involve hundreds of coalition
      aircraft flying over 3500 sorties. In these case studies, the method of
      intervention did not have a significant impact on human rights and thus
      disproves H<sub>4</sub>.</p>
      <p>Length of intervention appears to have an impact on whether the
      intervention was successful. The war in Afghanistan lasted nearly twenty
      years and did not lead to greater human rights in Afghanistan after it
      was over, but this looks to be a false correlation. While the
      intervention was ongoing, human rights were much higher in Afghanistan
      than before or after the intervention. Panama and BiH each had an
      intervention lasting just over forty days, and afterwards not only made
      peace deals but also established strong national governments and had
      years-long peacekeeping occupations by external military forces.
      Afghanistan never got that; it simply collapsed as the U.S. withdrew
      (although the long-term consequences of this action have yet to play
      out). While the data fail to disprove H<sub>5</sub>, the circumstances
      around the outlier certainly interfere with this answer.</p>

      <h2>Conclusion</h2>
      <p>This is far from a comprehensive review of all the effects of these
      interventions or all the interventions that occurred between 1985 and
      2022. Interventions like Libya in 2011, Haiti in 1994-95, and Somalia in
      1992-93 and the recent recommitment of U.S. military as advisors in 2022
      (Lopez, 2022) are just some of the interventions that can and should be
      considered for future study. Further variables that could be studied
      include government corruption, civilian casualties, crimes against
      humanity and war crimes, life expectancy, human development, GDP/capita,
      economic inequality, neocolonial economic policies used by the U.S and
      International Monetary Fund, and labor rights.</p>
      
      
      <p>This paper should not be taken as justification for all military
      actions ever taken by the U.S. or any state for that matter, nor should
      the reader take away from this that all humanitarian interventions are
      actually done for humanitarian reasons, as states (including the U.S.)
      have used R2P or “defending human rights” to justify wholly
      non-humanitarian actions. It is also worth noting that V-Dem’s
      definition of civil liberties is heavily influenced by liberal political
      thought, especially John Locke, and several people on the Left that have
      seen this research have taken issue with this. V-Dem’s data is widely
      used and trusted throughout academia and NGOs, and while there has been
      no reason to doubt the legitimacy of the dataset, it is strange to see
      such a positive correlation between intervention and human rights
      improvement. This may tie into the larger trend of American diabolism
      many American and European leftists fall into and as such warrants
      further research.</p>
      
      
      <p>Humanitarian intervention is a fascinating and difficult topic given
      the current state of the world. During the course of writing this paper,
      violence erupted across Sudan as the Sudanese government and Rapid
      Support Forces, a Sudanese paramilitary force, each tried to take over
      Khartoum (Akinwotu, 2023). Sudan’s history is a difficult and bloody
      one, as the recent Darfur genocide’s body count can attest to. While the
      U.N. and African Union stepped in to calm the violence and maintain
      peace in the region via UNAMID and the ICC has been investigating and
      prosecuting those involved since 2005, there was no U.S. or NATO
      military involvement in the situation. Whether that will stay the case
      with the current crisis likely hinges on whether the diplomatic and
      ceasefire efforts made by the international community keep the conflict
      from spiraling into a Egypt-Ethiopia proxy war; whether the intervention
      should happen depends on what actors know about MHI and its effects,
      both positive and negative.</p>

          <li id="fn1"><p> While the common understanding of the 1973 coup was
          that the CIA helped install Pinochet, Jack Devine (2014), a CIA agent in
          Chile at the time, claims that the CIA had absolutely nothing to do with
          the coup. The later support for Pinochet was not denied.<a
