        <h1>Keyboards</h1>
        <time datetime="2024/09/04"><i>September 4, 2024</i></time>
        <p>I have had an interest in mechanical keyboards for well over a year. I absolutely blame <a
          href="https://youtube.com/@HipyoTech">HipyoTech</a> for starting this hobby, especially his <a
          href="pp=ygUZbWVjaGFuaWNhbCBrZXlib2FyZCBzbm9icw%3D%3D">Mechanical Keyboard Snob</a> video. Becoming a mechanical
          keyboard hobbyist has bled into everything else I do, as I'm using them at home and at work.</p>
        <p>I started at MicroCenter with a Keychron V1 with Keychron Pro Brown switches. I used this for much of 2024,
          including bringing it to and from work to use at both my desk and my gaming setup at home (just a Dell Inspiron
          7567 gaming laptop from 2014 with the Keychron plugged in). I stuck with the browns for a few months, but I
          wanted to experiment with different swtiches and keycaps. I picked up two packs of Cherry MX Ergo Clear RBG
          switches, a heavy tactile switch with an early bump. I also got a set of pink keycaps from Reddragon. I found
          myself rather liking this setup. However, it sounded rather scratchy and bad. It felt good to type on and
          sounded fine-ish, but taking it back and forth to work was getting tiring, and more and more I found myself
          needing a numpad for typing ISBNs.</p>
        <p>Because of this, I got another Keychron, this time the Q12, a metal keyboard with a southpaw (left-hand)
          numpad. My reasoning was straightforward.</p>
        <ol>
          <li>I need a keyboard with a numpad.</li>
          <li>I don't like the keyboard supplied to us because it's $6 and I need to type for long periods of time.</li>
          <li>I don't want a keyboard with the numpad on the right because it means I have to angle myself when typing,
            and I've gotten too used to the convinience of a 75% keyboard.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>So I went with the only option -- a $230 mechanical keyboard. Thankfully MicroCenter had my back again and it
          was selling for only $106. Coming in again with brown switches, I have been using it at work ever since and it's
          been a great addition to my work, because not only is it much nicer to type on, but I can leave it there and I
          get a numpad! I've gotten pretty good at manipulating the southpaw numpad too; It's not too hard of a transition
          really.</p>
        <p>That being said, the browns weren't really cutting it, and I knew I wanted a heavy tactile switch because of
          how much I liked the Cherry MX Ergos. So I bought 105 Glorious Panda tactile switches (a 67g early tactile
          switch) and swapped them out over the weekend. They felt and sounded great for gaming at home, but when I took
          the Q12 back to work, I felt more worn out because of how much heavier the switches were to actuate, especially
          the spacebar. That was about two weeks ago at time of writing so I've mostly adapted and they do sound
          legitimately great. I currently use this at work.</p>
        <p>However, I've been feeling more disatisfired with my Keychron V1. I swapped all the browns out for ergo clears
          which helped with typing consistency (some of the old browns were really jammed in there because of too much
          action on the home row, let it never be said learning Vim doesn't come with its own problems), but they dont'
          feel that good compared to what I have now. Because of this, along with wanting to get away from the plastic
          case of the V1 and try out a 65% layout, I ordered the Womier SK65. This is a 65% alumninum chassis keyboard,
          meaning it loses the function row and more of the navigation keys from the Keychron V1. It just arrived today
          and I wrote this webpage with it. It comes with light linear switches, something I had never tried before (I've
          played with reds before and they just feel <em>bad</em> compared to the browns). I quite enjoy these switches!
          They come in at 38g, are pre-lubed, and have a wonderful marble-y sound when typing, which makes this a lot more
          fun when typing.</p>
        <p>I also ordered some keycaps with it. I'm not sure whether these are going on the Keychron Q12 or the Womier
          SK56, since I don't think the blue gradient works well with this cream, but who knows! This is a pretty fun
          hobby and I just love how personalied and customizable it is to each person. I may have just gotten hooked on
          the light linears I'm writing this on... and I spent 60 bucks on those Glorious Pandas (they were on sale).</p>
        <p>Welp, learn as you go I suppose.</p>
