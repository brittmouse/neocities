        <h1>ThinkPad T480, Pt. 3</h1>
        <time datetime="2024/11/24">November 24, 2024</time>
        <p>Things have changed a little bit since the <a href="./thinkpad-2.html">last time</a> I wrote about this. I'm
          still happily using the ThinkPad, but my journey with it has been both inspiring and frustrating.</p>

        <h2>Arch (By The Way)</h2>
        <p>Arch Linux with KDE Plasma was a really good time. Having in-depth control of my operating system is
          something I wanted, and I absolutely got it with Arch. Having access to all the up-to-date software I could
          ask for was very easy to get used to, especially with the AUR.</p>
        <p>KDE Plasma was a different matter. It used a lot of my system resources, which on a slightly older ThinkPad
          with a damaged internal battery was somewhat frustrating. The other frustrating thing to me was the entire
          aesthetic. I just do not like the glossy, shiny, frosted-glass finish of the desktop. It reminded me of the
          Windows 11 desktop, and that aesthetic was bad enough that it caused me to switch to Linux in the first place.
          I also didn't like the KDE apps like Akregator, Kate, and Konsole much. While they worked, I just did not
          enjoy using them in any capacity. No hate to the developers who made such great apps! I just don't like that
          style of application.</p>
        <p>After about three weeks with Arch, it was starting to slow down on me, and I realized that I hadn't rebooted
          the computer since to allow it to rest some. So I went and rebooted it. When I saw the decryption prompt, my
          world stopped.</p>
        <p>I forgot my encryption password.</p>
        <p>Well, no matter, I can check the Bitwarden app I have installed on my Linux Mint laptop since I have it.
          Except when I checked the Flatpak app, my encryption password wasn't there, despite me putting that password
          into the Bitwarden app on the ThinkPad.</p>
        <p>A ThinkPad I couldn't unlock without it.</p>
        <p>(Turns out, I had properly backed it up, it was just that the Flatpak app was, for whatever reason, not
          showing it. It showed up in the Firefox extension well after this but I didn't check that in time.)</p>
        <p>Yeah that was a pretty miserable day. Without thinking about it, I had lost everything on the ThinkPad just
          because (I thought) stupid Bitwarden screwed me over, or that I didn't actually save it even though I was
          certain I had (and I did). While I hadn't lost much, I did lose some unpushed dotfiles that I had changed and
          committed before doing this, along with the start of a piece of flash fiction I was writing and enjoying. I
          still haven't remembered what that story was about, so it is gone forever.</p>

        <h2>NixOS and the Curse of <code>sudo nixos-rebuild</code></h2>
        <p>Once I saw the encryption screen and realized I didn't have my password anymore, I began looking for a new
          Linux distribution to put on it. I had heard some very interesting things about NixOS from <a
            href="https://www.youtube.com/@vimjoyer">Vimjoyer</a> and <a
            href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwfKlX3rA6E&pp=ygUUbm8gYm9pbGVycGxhdGUgbml4b3M%3D">No Boilerplate</a>.
          I knew that it was an operating system built off of a declarative package manager called Nix that used a
          functional programming language called Nix. I knew you could install files like you would plugins for Neovim,
          where instead of typing an install script for each plugin you wanted, you write down which plugins you want in
          a file / multiple files and let the package manager (in my case Lazy) do the work. I also knew it was
          generally perceived as harder to use than Arch so I figured I would continue to indulge my hipster brain and
          install NixOS.</p>
        <p>Before this, I tested it in a GNOME Boxes virtual machine. It wasn't that bad just starting out. The 24.05
          release is somewhat old but worked well. Originally I was testing with the KDE install ISO, but this has
          caused some problems for me and I found that the stable GNOME install ISO would work in the VM after a proper
          install, no matter the desktop environment I chose to install. My first VM used the Xfce desktop, a very
          lightweight and minimal desktop environment, and my second used Cinnamon (shocker). That one came later and
          I'll explain why in a bit.</p>
        <p>I played around some with installing software in the Xfce install first, and while a few things annoyed me, I
          was so excited to successfully rebuild the system without an error that I got up from my seat and clapped. I
          finally felt like I was moving on to harder things, and I was super excited for it. The things that annoyed me
          weren't that big but did act like the rock under the rug. Running Neovim as a superuser (<code>sudo
            nvim</code>) causes the editor to not load a config. I'm not really sure as to the reason for this; maybe
          it's because when it runs as a superuser it looks for a global config instead of a local config like the one
          stored in <code>~/.config</code>. Running <code>sudoedit</code> ran Nano (ew) even after I set the editor
          variable to Neovim.</p>
        <p>After testing it out for a while, I decided NixOS with Xfce was what I wanted to run next. So I flashed the
          GNOME install ISO to the flash drive and went through the Calamares installer. That's the same one you find
          when installing something like EndeavourOS. It went smoothly and I had a working NixOS on my hands!</p>

        <h3>Tier 1: <code>/etc/nixos/configuration.nix</code></h3>
        <p>I started by editing the configuration file in <code>/etc/nixos</code>. I installed stuff like Neovim, Emacs,
          system utilities like Tmux and Zsh, fun terminal stuff like Starship, and graphical programs like LibreOffice,
          the kitty terminal, and Brave. Each time I modified that environment packages array, I had to save and run
          <code>sudo nixos-rebuild switch .</code> in the <code>/etc/nixos</code> directory. It was pretty basic but
          it let me use stuff normally.</p>
        <p>Then I realized that the Neovim version was 0.9.5, and not 0.10.2.</p>
        <p>Because I was running NixOS 24.05, not all the software in the (very large) Nix package repos were bleeding
          edge. This makes sense for a server or LTS desktop because you want to make sure everything works. However, a
          new Neovim was something I really wanted since treesitter only works consistently with the newest stable
          release. So I wasn't going to stick in Tier 1 for long. I had to advance.</p>

        <h3>Tier 2: Flakes and Home Manager with a Side of "Bashing My Head Into A Wall"</h3>
        <p>I watched Vimjoyer's video on setting up flakes and Home Manager and followed along. I used the unstable
          package repositories so I would have access to the most recent stable Neovim, along with the most recent
          versions of any software I was regularly using, like Vesktop. However, setting it up as he recommended caused
          things to fail constantly. It never once rebuilt properly even after running <code>sudo nixos-rebuild switch
            --flake .</code> and not having semicolon errors. I had giant stack trace errors relating to some damn bug
          in the code that I couldn't decipher because the stack traces were dogshit. It ate up far too much of my
          time.</p>
        <p>This is where that second NixOS VM comes into play. I spun up a second one running Cinnamon and started
          following a different guide on how to do it. Shockingly, the new guide worked perfectly, and I used that for
          my ThinkPad setup. I finally had what I needed.</p>
        <p>Or so I thought. See, I wanted to use Git to track my changes to the config diretory and back it up to
          GitHub. I didn't really want to run a Git repo in <code>/etc</code> mostly because I'm not sure it would work.
          So I copied all the files in <code>/etc/nixos</code> down to a folder in my home directory and started
          rebuilding my system using <code>sudo nixos-rebuild switch --flake .</code> outside of where it's supposed to
          live. I saw some people disagreeing with others' decision to do this on Reddit but I went ahead with it
          anyways.</p>
        <p>So now, finally, I had a tracked NixOS configuration that I could modify using a non-superuser Neovim,
          meaning I had all the plugins and LSPs I needed. I assumed.</p>

        <h3>Tier 3: What do You Mean I Can't Use Lazy? Why is Cinnamon Doing This??</h3>
        <h4>NixOS hates your language server</h4>
        <p>Because NixOS handles package installation from a single file (or multiple files, if you want to break the
          config up and use imports to get the main file to recognize them), other package managers installing and
          running binaries is generally frowned upon by the system. It also generally prefers configuration of binaries
          like Zsh and Starship to be handled in a .nix config file.</p>
        <p>This is actually pretty neat, as the OS will translate the Nix config to whatever language the program is
          intended to be configured with and then create a read-only file sym-linked to what it generated. So for
          Starship, I could tell it my character was going to be the lambda glyph from Nerd Fonts and that I wanted to
          use Nerd Font symbols for the prompt instead of Noto emojis and it would create
          <code>~/.config/starship.toml</code> as a read-only file for Starship to use.</p>
        <p>However, this made using <a href="https://github.com/nvim-lua/kickstart.nvim">Kickstart.nvim</a> a hassle
          since it uses Lazy as its package manager and uses Mason to install language servers. Language servers
          installed via Mason are not permitted to run on NixOS, since it's an executable creating a runtime outside of
          the <code>conf.nix</code> files. I couldn't run Lua LS, Emmet LS, or Marksman at all.</p>
        <p>What NixOS wants you to do is put those (Neo)vim plugins into your <code>conf.nix</code> file and tell Neovim
          to run with those plugins. It wants the same for Emacs too, which is why trying to get Doom Emacs to work was
          also a massive hassle (I was planning on using org + evil for writing; while there is an orgmode Neovim
          plugin, I'm back to Markdown for creative writing). This was well outside what I was comfortable handling.
          I couldn't even get spell check with aspell, enchant, or hunspell working either despite me installing those
          binaries and telling Doom Emacs to load them.</p>

        <h4>NixOS hates your Wi-Fi hotspot</h4>
        <p>Another problem I had was connecting to Wi-Fi properly. Because I don't work from home, I bring my laptop to
          work daily so I can do things like scroll through social media, chat with friends on Discord, and write
          creatively and for this website through Neovim. Xfce was posing a couple issues for me around what it was
          willing to connect to. It would let me connect to some websites, but other websites like Discord were a no go.
          I didn't really understand this but I figured disabling the firewall setting in <code>conf.nix</code> would
          solve it. It didn't work.</p>
        <p>Xfce was also definitely showing its age. While a great retro desktop environment, it was so retro that it
          didn't click with me. So I went back to Cinnamon as my desktop of choice. I liked how easy it was to move to a
          different DE though! I just changed a couple of lines in <code>conf.nix</code>, rebuilt the system, and then
          rebooted. Just like that, I was running Cinnamon and not Xfce. I got it set up with the Everforest GTK theme
          and it was actually quite pretty.</p>
        <p>However, this made the Wi-Fi problem worse. Instead of having limited connectivity over mobile hotspot, I got
          <em>no</em> connectivity over mobile hotspot. Progress!</p>
        <p>Imagine my surprise when I go to check Tumblr over lunch at work and I get a Firefox error page saying it
          couldn't communicate over the network despite me being connected. That put a serious damper on my desire to
          keep using NixOS. I thought I could prove myself by learning to live with it and get it to do what I want, but
          in the end, I couldn't keep up.</p>

        <h2>Fedora: Knowing My Limits</h2>
        <p>I distinctly remember what I was doing when I decided I was done with NixOS. It was 10 days into my
          experiment. I was sitting on the couch in the living room, "watching" Formula 1 qualifying, and fighting with
          NixOS over trying to get a damn spellcheck installed for Doom Emacs. I thought 'Is this even worth it
          anymore?' It really wasn't. I wasn't enjoying myself. I wasn't getting stuff done. I was messing with my
          config file hoping that once I got it right, I could work with no issue. I had become the <a
            href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=korOpibkm6g">bigboxSWE </a> meme.</p>
        <p>I decided that Saturday to ditch NixOS. But what was I going to move back to?</p>
        <ol>
          <li>Linux Mint</li>
          <p>Linux Mint 22 had been out for at least a month by then. While I'm quite comfortable with Linux Mint,
            having used it for over a year, I wasn't interested in moving back to an Ubuntu-base, as I knew the software
            was going to be a little older than I wanted.</p>
          <li>EndeavourOS</li>
          <p>My mini PC is running EndeavourOS. While it works well, I've been enjoying the Arch system less and less as
            time has gone on.</p>
          <li>Arch Linux</li>
          <p>I had the same problem with this as I did EndeavourOS. I like vanilla Arch over EndeavourOS, but it's still
            an Arch system. I wanted something different.</p>
          <li>Fedora Linux</li>
          <p>I had heard about this first from The Linux Experiment, back when he was running Fedora with GNOME instead
            of Tuxedo OS. I was interested in having more up-to-date software without the dangers of a rolling release
            like Arch. Plus Fedora has about a dozen spins of their Workstation with different desktops, like Xfce, KDE
            (which I don't enjoy), i3, and Cinnamon. Also, Fedora 41 had just released, so I wouldn't have to worry
            about some of the software being 6 months old.</p>
        </ol>
        <p>After that decision process, the choice was basically made. Fedora Cinnamon, here I come!</p>
        <p>Before that though, I decided I was going to test it out in a VM again before making the switch over. I
          figured it'd be better to make sure the install process would go smoothly before flashing the ISO to my
          designated Distro Flash Drive<sup>TM</sup>. It all went smoothly, and it felt great being back in a desktop
          environment I enjoyed and wanted to keep using.</p>
        <p>I've been running Fedora for a couple of weeks now and I'm very pleased with it. Package management is much
          simpler than it is with NixOS, but there's less variety than Arch Linux; programs like Kanata (a keyboard
          remapper), Zellij (an alternate terminal multiplexer to Tmux), and Starship (a pretty terminal prompt) are not
          in the Fedora repos. At least with these, they are all Rust crates, so you could either download the
          precompiled binaries they provide on their Githubs or compile it yourself using <code>cargo</code>. The
          package manager syntax is also much more familiar, with strings like <code>dnf search vim</code> instead
          of <code>pacmac -Ss vim</code>.</p>
        <p>The main reason I moved back to an "easier" distro is because I wasn't getting anything out of the harder
          package managers besides frustration. I just needed things to get simpler so I didn't have to worry about some
          damn strange syntax in a .nix file or trying to figure out pacman's syntax. I've heard plenty of jokes about
          DNF being slow, but that's just the default settings, which can be changed with a simple edit to
          <code>/etc/dnf/dnf.conf</code>. The default settings for some reason limit DNF to only <em>three</em> parallel
          downloads.</p>
        <p>Here's my entire <code>dnf.conf</code> in case you want to see:</p>
        <blockquote style="font-family: monospace; font-size: 0.9em;">
          <div>[main]</div>
          <div>gpgCheck=True</div>
          <div>installonly_limit=3</div>
          <div>best=False</div>
          <div>skip_if_unavailable=True</div>
          <div>max_parallel_downloads=10</div>
          <div>fastestmirror=True</div>
        </blockquote>
        <p>It should go without saying that increasing max parallel downloads from three to ten makes the process of
          installing and upgrading software much faster. DNF can actually support up to twenty max parallel downloads,
          so if you're really feeling the need for speed, you can crank it way up.</p>
        <p>I imagine I'll be staying on Fedora for a while. DNF is nice and fast, the software I want is far more up to
          date than the 6-month Ubuntu releases (especially Neovim; it's wild that Debian Sid has 0.7.2 and Fedora 41
          has 0.10.2), and stuff just works unlike NixOS.</p>
        <p>Of course, I haven't extricated the brainworm of endless configuration and customization. I've switched from
          LazyVim back to Kickstart on this install, I've moved from Tokyo Night to One Dark, I'm trying out Zellij
          again compared to Tmux, and I'm not even staying on Cinnamon all the time. I'm trying out tiling window
          managers like Awesome and I've already wasted much of November 23 trying to get the themes to look less bad.
          We'll see where this takes me going forward.</p>
        <p>Edit: Somehow, git diffs from me fixing some spelling errors got inserted into this file while I was editing.
          I'm at a loss as to how that possibly could have happened, but they've been removed.</p>
