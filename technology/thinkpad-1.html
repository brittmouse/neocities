        <h1>Thinkpad T480, Pt. 1</h1>
        <time datetime="2024/09/22"><i>September 22, 2024</i></time>
        <p>You may recall from <a href="./desktop.html">this post</a> that I've been using a Lenovo IdeaPad 3 for over a
          year now, and while it has served me well, there are things about it that I'm not that happy with. For
          starters, the chassis is a cheap plastic that's exhibiting a good amount of wear now, especially towards the
          rear of the base. There's a small but long crack along the USB-A port towards the Escape key. None of the keys
          are bad. The screen is fine. I just want a change. I'm still absolutely going to keep using the IdeaPad but I
          wanted to try something out.</p>
        <p>I found a Thinkpad T480 with an i7-8550U (making it quad-core), 16 GB of DDR4 RAM, a 512 GB SSD, and Windows
          11 Pro for only $170. It included both batteries, but I don't remember seeing a power adapter included,
          meaning I'll have to check that. There were cheaper ones available, but there were usually lacking either the
        batteries, the power adapter, an SSD, or a mix of those. These would generally be pretty cheap repairs but I
          figured I'd save myself the hassle this time. If this does turn into a hobby I might get into fixing up
          laptops and selling / donating them with Linux Mint preinstalled, but I'm not sure.</p>
        <p>Old laptops in general are something I'm getting more interested in, having seen two videos on installing
          Linux (specifically Ubuntu and Linux Mint) onto old Intel Macbooks. None of the new laptops out there seem
          particularly interesting except for the Framework 13 and that's quite an investment. If this turns into
          another expensive hobby like <a href="./keyboards.html">mechanical keyboards</a> then I'm screwed.</p>
        <p>It'll probably be better for me than a Warhammer miniature collection though!</p>

        <h2>Current Thinkpad Plans</h2>
        <p>The Thinkpad arrives sometime this week. I have a couple ideas for what to do with it.</p>
        <ol>
          <li>Put EndeavourOS on it, running either KDE Plasma or Cinnamon.</li>
          <li>Put Debian on it, specifically Debian Trixie; alternatively, installing Linux Mint Debian Edition and
            enabling the testing repositories.</li>
          <li>Turning into the start of a homelab or server, running Debian or Ubuntu Server (unlikely seeing as it's
            just a 512 GB SSD).</li>
        </ol>
        <p>I'd like to have something to hack around on, largely for what I already use my IdeaPad for. I really just
          wanted to try out a new form factor and mess around with a different distribution without running it solely in
          a virtual machine or messing with partitions. I'll be sure to keep this story updated!</p>
