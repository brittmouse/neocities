        <h1>Finally Having a Desktop</h1>
        <time datetime="2024/09/09"><i>September 9, 2024</i></time>
        <h2>A Bit Of Background</h2>
        <p>I was a laptop-only user for probably 10 years. My old desktop was running Windows XP back when Windows 8 was
          new. I don't remember much from that time but I do remember playing Space Cadet Pinball a lot. I skipped past
          Vista and 7, staying on XP until my uncle passed away and I got his Dell Inspiron gaming laptop running a
          Windows 8. It was a major step up in computing power and it has stayed with me for the past ten years, loaded
          down with schoolwork from middle school on to college, multiple games, and a Modding folder for Fallout 4
          larger than the game itself.</p>
        <p>However, after graduating college, I was strapped for cash after spending about $300 dollars of my graduation
          money on a refurbished Lenovo IdeaPad. I was stuck with the Inspiron and its age was showing. 8 GB of RAM, a
          ten-year-old SSD, and a NVidia GTX 1050 Ti were just not enough to be playing things like Fallout 4, or
          even editing papers in Word (this is the reason I switched to Google Docs and LibreOffice on that machine).
          Even after upgrading the RAM, it wasn't enough. So I decided to finally get a desktop machine.</p>

        <h2>Decisions, Decisions</h2>
        <p>As much as I like the freedom that a laptop provides, I have a pretty crappy IdeaPad 3 that was not enough to
          satisfy my wants. While it can run games like Star Wars: Battlefront II (2005) and Minecraft Java well enough,
          it was not enough to play anything more taxing than that at any reasonable speed. War Thunder felt like
          driving a stuttering snail instead of playing the game even at the lowest quality setting.</p>
        <p>So I wanted a desktop machine, but how was I going to go about choosing one? I had a few requirements.</p>
        <ol>
          <li>Small enough to fit at my desk without hogging space or getting in the way of anything.</li>
          <li>Something powerful enough to play games like Fallout 4 and War Thunder.</li>
          <li>An AMD machine.</li>
          <li>Linux support (whether pre-loaded or my own decision).</li>
          <li>Something I could program on if I decided to go hard into building Rust or something.</li>
          <li>Preferred: from a smaller manufacturer instead of a major company like Dell or HP.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>That gets you a pretty narrow list. Essentially I was choosing from 1 of 3 manufacturers: System76,
          Minisforum, and Slimbook. Specifically, I was looking at the Slimbook One, the System76 Meerkat, and the
          Minisforum UM790 Pro. The System76 Meerkat uses a 13-gen Intel chip, with i3-1315U, i5-1340P, and i7-1360P
          offerings. I'm pretty glad I didn't get that after the debacle with the 13th and 14th-gen Intel chips, and
          while Pop!_OS is great and widely loved, I had been using Linux Mint for nearly a year and I liked Cinnamon
          far more than GNOME. Slimbook's offer was interesting but I ultimately went for the Minisforum UM790 Pro.</p>
        <p>The Ryzen 9 7940HS is a really good processor, and it's very fast when compiling Rust binaries or playing
          games. It also comes with integrated Radeon 780M graphics, which manages to handle Fallout 4 and War Thunder
          pretty well, although it's not as smooth as I'd like. The games run fast enough for playing, but I've seen it
          struggle a lot when rendering foliage, so the wilderness areas of the Commonwealth and grasslands maps on War
          Thunder can slow the refresh rate down a lot. I would not trust this to play something like Doom Eternal or
          Cyberpunk well without an eGPU, which I may get in the future.</p>

        <h2>Up and Running</h2>
        <p>After saving up enough money from my job, I bought the barebones version of the UM790 Pro off Amazon while it
          was on sale, meaning I saved a ton getting this. I also went to MicroCenter and got 24 GB of DDR5-5600, a 1 TB
          SSD, and a budget 21.5" 1080p 60Hz monitor. Again, I am space limited, and paying something like 500 bucks for
          a 2K screen that would look massive in my room felt like overkill. The RAM and SSD came from Crucial, the
          same company I used to upgrade my Inspiron's RAM from 8 GB to <em>32</em> GB.</p>
        <p>Setup wasn't difficult as I imagined, largely because I didn't have to assemble a tower with a motherboard,
          CPU, GPU, etc.; I just had to insert the SSD and RAM. (Not that building a tower would be that difficult, I
          just haven't done it before.)</p>
        <p>The most annoying part of setting up the PC was getting Linux working right, and that's enitrely a skill
          issue on my part. I've used Linux Mint for a long time on the IdeaPad but I decided for the desktop I would
          use EndeavourOS, an Arch-based distro with an easy install via Calamares and a great colorscheme. I used this
          for about a week but for whatever reason I decided that I wanted to try a vanilla Arch install. While I did it
          correctly with the GNOME install, I don't like GNOME so I tried redoing the manual install (via SSH from my
          Ideapad) with Plasma 6, which I managed to mess up (again, skill issue). So I tried again with
          <code>archinstall</code> and while it installed correctly, I eventually gave up on it and just installed Mint
          on it. Mint hasn't been flawless but it's been a lot less of a headache for gaming, modding, and day-to-day
          stuff. I would love to try Arch or EndeavourOS again but I'm sticking with Mint for the time being.</p>

        <h2>Gaming And Modding</h2>
        <p>The <em>real</em> hassle has been modding Fallout 4. You'll recall that I got this because I wanted to run
          Fallout 4. Well I play Fallout 4 like any sane individual - modded out the ass. Vanilla FO4 is buggy, ugly,
          and has some of the worst weapon design I've ever seen. While I generally keep default clothes for settlers
          and all because I don't hate the aesthetic entirely, I mod in tons of weapons, armors, ammos, and gameplay
          changes like <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/66071">True Damage</a> and
          <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/68655">Hardcore Health Overhaul</a>. I had both
          hyper-realistic and lore-friendly weapon mods on the laptop, but for the desktop I've stuck with the more
          lore-friendly weapon mods from the likes of <a
            href="https://next.nexusmods.com/profile/DegenerateDak/mods?gameId=1151">Dak</a> and <a
            href="https://next.nexusmods.com/profile/CSEPteam/about-me?gameId=1151">the CSEP team</a>. Combined with
          True Damage and <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/66051">Munitions</a>, both myself and my
          enemies are a lot easier to kill, and I enjoy that over bullet sponges.</p>
        <p>However, modding on <em>Linux</em> has been a hassle and a half. Mod Organizer 2, which is the mod manager I
          use for Fallout 4 (and New Vegas on the gaming laptop, so help me I will get that working), is not meant to
          work on Linux at all. Their webpage has a section about adding Linux support and the answer is "Stop using a
          non-gaming operating system," which is a bit rich since SteamOS and Proton exist. There is a process to make
          it work but it's a hassle.</p>
        <ol>
          <li>Install Wine and your game on Steam, along with your preferred version of Proton.</li>
          <li>Install winetricks and protontricks (this involved installing like 30 libraries, which may break on you).
          </li>
          <li>Go to <a href="https://github.com/rockerbacon/modorganizer2-linux-installer">this Github repo</a> and
            follow the install instructions. Except for the prefix creation, this was bugged for me.</li>
          <li>Setup MO2 to work with your Nexus Mods account.</li>
          <li>Optional: downgrade Fallout 4 to pre-next-gen update to work with older mods and spite Todd.</li>
          <li>Install Fallout 4 Script Extender and the Unofficial Fallout 4 Patch.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>Despite that, it worked! For about a month. It stopped loading F4SE after an update, so I'm wondering if MO2
        relies on some old version of a library. That was about a week ago and I'm still locked out of my modded
        campaign, even after reboots and further updates. I may talk more on this when I get it fixed.</p>

        <h2>Final Thoughts</h2>
        <p>I'm much happier with a mini PC Linux desktop than I am with my old gaming laptop. This is far more powerful
          and can actually handle the games I'm more interested in playing. This certainly won't be playing Space Marine
          2 without an eGPU but for fun stuff like Battlebit or Just Cause 3 or old favorites it's super comfortable.
        </p>
        <p>I haven't done a lot of programming on this machine but it compiles Rust very quickly, meaning crates like
          thokr or starship are installed very quickly and Rustlings doesn't take multiple seconds to compile answers.
        </p>
        <p>I'm excited to see how this setup develops in the future but for now I'm happy.</p>
