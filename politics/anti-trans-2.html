      <h1>The Trans Fight in Georgia: Sine Die</h1>
      <time datetime="2025/04/04">April 4, 2025</time>

      <h2>In Brief</h2>
      <p>
        It's the last day of the legislative session for the Georgia General Assembly in 2025! That means that the flow
        of anti-trans bills will stop after today. However, that also means that it's also going to be a firehose of the
        last few bills they can squeeze out. This last week has been the background of a lot of losses and a lot of
        advocacy against these bills. While we've had small successes and big losses, it hasn't been a complete
        curbstomp of trans rights.
      </p>

      <h3>What's Passed</h3>
      <p>
        Of the bills we've been looking that, SB1 and HB267 (trans sports bans) have passed both chambers. However,
        while the original HB267 had some <a href="./hb267-analysis.html">serious attacks</a> on legal recognition for
        transgender and intersex people in the state, <em>every one</em> of those sections got removed in committee. It
        could have been a <em>lot</em> worse. The House debate on SB1 was carried by the same rep who sponsored HB267,
        Chairman Josh Bonner, who was even more aggressive on attacking Democrats for opposing the bill, calling
        invocations of "love your neighbor" as "perversions of scripture." Frankly, I'm happy to have seem him so mad.
      </p>
      <p>
        I also saw Democrats really stepping up on performative attacks on particularly bad bills backed by the
        Republican Party. On Wednesday, Senate Democrats submitted tons of amendments to stall HB127; it was originally
        a bill to increase sick days for teachers from 3 to 5, but became a zombie bill after the Senate Rules Committee
        shoved the language of SB120 into the bill, which is essentially a "Don't Say Gay" bill for schools throughout
        the state. Democrats submitted dozens of amendments that said things like "The Confederate Sates of America was
        a nation separate and apart from the from the United States of America, founded in unconstitutional rebellion,"
        and "Academic freedom in the state of Georgia is under greater threat than ever. Please help."
        <sup><a href="#1">1</a></sup>
      </p>
      <p>
        Meanwhile, House Democrats staged a walkout<sup><a href="#2">2</a></sup> on SB185, a bill that would ban
        transgender inmates from receiving gender-affirming care while incarcerated. It received more support from
        Senate Democrats than I originally expected, with Sen. Elena Parent being the most surprising. While Republicans
        refused to give statistics on the number of people affected and the actual saving of the legislation to
        taxpayers and instead focused specifically on the anti-surgery measure in the bill, Democrats hammered the bill
        for targeting all of 5 trans people held by the Georgia Department of Corrections and being unnecessarily cruel,
        before almost off of them walked out. The Majority Leader proceeded to complain at the well about how much money
        Democrats wanted to "waste" on this while spending significantly more in state funds by speaking in the first
        place.
      </p>
      <p>
        Other bad bills to have passed include SB36 or RFRA, which essentially legalizes discrimination if that
        discrimination is based on religious beliefs. They made a big show of saying this would be good for minority
        religions in the state, while every minority religious person there slammed the bill. It passed the House (not
        completely on a party line vote though) and Governor Brian Kemp signed it into law this morning.
      </p>

      <h3>What Hasn't (So Far)</h3>
      <p>
        There are several zombie bills to be concerned about before the day is over. SB74, an anti-library bill, has
        been put into HB483. SB248, another anti-library bill, isn't moving but we're fairly concerned about it either
        becoming a zombie bill or getting movement in next year's session.
      </p>
      <p>
        As for immediately harmful bills, SB30 and SB39 are still up for consideration, and may be voted on at any point
        today as they're both on the House Rules Committee calendar. SB30 is a bill that would ban all gender-affirming
        care for minors instead of just surgeries like last year's ban, but it has been heavily amended to grandfather
        in minors that are already receiving that care, meaning if the House votes to pass it, it will have to go back
        to the Senate for approval. SB39 meanwhile is a state employees' health insurance care ban for any
        gender-affirming care. Agencies and state-operated schools (like University System of Georgia and Technical
        College System of Georgia member schools) can still purchase private health insurance for gender-affirming care
        coverage, but I doubt many are going to do that.
      </p>
      <p>
        Word on the street here is that Blake Tillery has been pushing too hard with these anti-trans bills and has
        pissed off enough people in Republican leadership that they're intentionally refusing to hear any of his own
        priorities; he's mainly doing this to beef up his own credentials for a primary run in 2026, potentially
        Lieutenant Governor. I am happy to report it is not just the Left that infights.
      </p>

      <h2>My Plans</h2>
      <p>
        I plan to be here as long as I can. I'll take a break in the evening, but I fully intend to watch the end of the
        session in person. There will be a ton of cheering and celebration, with lawmakers tearing up copies of bills
        and throwing them into the air like confetti. It will also likely be late at night, potentially after midnight.
        Although according to the clocks in the House and the Senate, it's only midnight when they say it is.
