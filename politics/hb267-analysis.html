      <h1>The Trans Fight in Georgia: HB267, Part 2</h1>
      <time datetime="2025/02/26">February 26, 2025</time>

      <p>
        This was originally going to be the start of <a href="./hb267-hearing.html">this blog post</a>, but as this
        turned into a giant ad hoc breakdown of the entire bill, I figured it would be best to post this separately.
        HB267 is a significant anti-trans bill introduced to the Georgia House that would ban transgender student
        athletes from participating on sport teams that match their gender identity and strip "gender" as a protected
        category under the Georgia hate crime law (OCGA 17-10-17(b))<sup><a href="#1">1</a></sup
        >.
      </p>
      <p>
        Because bills are dense and I'm going to be including lots of citations, I am including PDF files of both
        <a class="pdf" href="./attachments/HB267_LC-49-2204.pdf">the bill as introduced</a> and
        <a class="pdf" href="./attachments/HB267_SUB_LC-49-2270S.pdf">the bill as amended</a> after going through the
        House Education Policy Subcommittee. For simplicity, I'm going to be citing these as HB267 and HB267S (for
        "substitute") respectively; if I were to point to line 42 of the original bill, I would cite it as
        <cite>(HB267, 42)</cite>.
      </p>

      <h2>Background: Section 1-1</h2>
      <p>
        Section 1-1 here simply titles the bill the "Riley Gaines Act," after collegiate swimmer Riley Gaines. The
        reason this name was chosen was because of an incident here in Georgia that poured gasoline on debate. During an
        NCAA national swimming championship in 2022, transgender woman Lia Thomas beat Riley Gaines in the 500-yard
        freestyle. Gaines placed 3rd, meaning she wasn't even denied the win, but went on a national press spree to
        complain regardless. This championship win has eclipsed the entirety of Thomas' swimming career, with
        unremarkable results generally being the norm, including placing <em>dead last</em> in the 100-yard freestyle
        finals later that day.
      </p>
      <p>
        Conservatives have used Lia Thomas and other women they assume to be transgender as a cudgel against trans
        rights in America. During floor debate on SB1, another trans sports ban (because that's what matters to
        Republicans and not Medicaid expansion or affordable housing), Imane Khalif was cited as reason to institute
        this ban.
      </p>
      <p>
        Imane Khalif is an Algerian Olympic boxer who won gold in 2024. I know for a fact that Khalif is not a trans
        woman because Algeria prohibits transition (under the guise of "crossdressing"), and they would not send someone
        to the Olympics who was violating that rule. Conservatives still used her as a talking point, using the phrase
        "savagely beating" more than one during the floor debate. First, of course it's savage, it's <em>boxing</em>,
        that's the entire sport. Second, I find it notable they used the word "savage" to describe an African woman
        dueling white European competitors, as if there's a racial element to their animus. I've called Republican
        senators <a href="./the-ongoing-coup.html#h2-advocacy">wannabe plantation owners</a> before, and this further
        cemented my belief.
      </p>

      <h2>Sports Bans Again: Sections 2-1, 2-2, and 3-1</h2>
      <p>
        These sections address what the bill is marketed as, banning transgender student athletes form participating on
        teams that align with their gender identity. It also bans them from bathrooms, locker rooms, changing rooms, and
        shower rooms that align with their gender identity during sporting events, including matches, scrimmages, and
        tryouts (but not practices, likely due to them already being banned from those by forcing off the team).
      </p>
      <p>The method by which this ban is enforced is deeply reactionary. Sex is defined as such:</p>
      <blockquote id="sex-definition">
        [A]n individual's biological sex, either male or female. An individual's sex can be observed or clinically
        verified at or before birth and in no case is an individual's sex determined by stipulation or
        self-identification <cite>(HB267S, 46-48)</cite>.
      </blockquote>
      <p>
        This is an intensely regressive and punitive definition of sex that goes well outside the scope necessary for
        enforcing this sort of ban. While the conservative arguing points around bills like this have focused on "men in
        girls' sports," this is only because they do not view transgender people as belonging to the gender they
        identify with. We are a conscious, willing, and visible violation of a binary handed down by their God. Over and
        over again, I have heard "God created humans male and female" from pastors, legislators, representatives of
        religious organizations like the Georgia Baptists, and failed comedians turning to conservatism because they
        have no other skills. Instead of leaving us the hell alone, our violations of the natural order deserve
        punishment.
      </p>
      <p>
        This doesn't just affect transgender people though. Intersex people are also completely written out of the law.
        The definitions of female and male differ only in whether they produce eggs or sperm, and both definitions under
        this bill include the phrase "or would have such capabilities but for a developmental or genetic anomaly or
        historical accident <cite>(HB267S, 31-32)</cite>." This aims to capture all of the genetic diversity within the
        intersex community and force it into either the square hole or the circle hole, erasing all institutional
        recognition of these identities as anything other than genetic anomalies that need to be fixed. It's just
        another policy in the long history of anti-intersex violence, where conservatives demand that humans fall into
        their holy binary. If binary was natural, there would be no reason for them to enforce it. But the binary is
        unnatural, and that is why violence must be applied to ensure compliance.
      </p>
      <p>
        The actual sports stuff is depressing. Banning transgender students from participating in athletics regardless
        of their athletic ability is to deprive them from activities that encourage teamwork, self-improvement, and
        cooperation with people they don't get along with. It would also be good for the cisgender participants, as it
        means they get to learn and play alongside someone who isn't like them, which would help them grow as a person
        too. Much of this same backlash came about during the desegregation of schools and sports in the latter half of
        the 20th century. The detractors were wrong then and they are wrong now. These policies would only hurt an
        already vulnerable population and subject gender non-conforming students to more scrutiny from peers and
        superiors, resulting in more bullying, harassment, and worse mental health outcomes for everyone targeted.
      </p>

      <h2>Sections 4-1, 4-2, and 4-3: Further Derecognition</h2>
      <p>
        While I talked about how transgender and intersex people were being written out of the law as it relates to
        sports, the rest of this bill goes well beyond the supposed topic of school sports. Keep in mind this was
        assigned to the House Education Committee and nothing else, despite the rest of the bill impacting criminal
        codes <cite>(HB267S 387-402)</cite>, issuing hunting licenses <cite>(HB267S, 560-563)</cite>, and jury selection
        <cite>(HB267S, 542-543)</cite>. The majority of the debate centering around school sports serves to hide the
        bitter pill of being defined out of the law.
      </p>

      <h3>Section 4-1</h3>
      <p>
        While the definitions in the previous sections would have defined transgender people out of existence as it
        relates to sports, several sections here define transgender and intersex people out of the entire Georgia Code
        and include language to potentially strip anti-discrimination protections from women at large. Section 4-1
        inserts a new section into Title 1, Chapter 2, just after the section defining the rights of female citizens.
        This section includes the definition of sex laid out <a href="#sex-definition">earlier</a>, and two sobering
        paragraphs.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
        <p>(2) With respect to sex, the term "equal" does not mean same or identical.</p>
        <p>(3) With respect to sex, separate accommodations are not necessarily unequal.</p>
        <cite>(HB267S, 302-303)</cite>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
        While this is almost certainly included to allow for sex-separated bathrooms, stooping to phrases like "separate
        but equal" introduces a whole host of potential ways for conservatives to strip women's rights back. What if
        this language gets used to justify not enforcing equal rights to things like bank accounts, drivers licenses,
        and access to jobs? This section is so damn vague it could justify nearly anything.
      </p>
      <p>
        The section goes on to single out living facilities, domestic violence shelters, and rape crisis centers as
        particularly sensitive and require sex segregation <cite>(HB267S, 313-318)</cite>. This plays into old
        transphobic tropes of transgender women in particular being unsafe, dangerous, hypersexual super criminals that
        will rape every woman around them when given the chance. It's a particularly strong projection seeing as cops,
        coaches, and pastors, many of whom are strongly conservative, are the ones actually responsible for so many of
        the sexual assaults we see.
      </p>

      <h3>Section 4-2</h3>
      <p>
        Section 4-2 <cite>(HB267S, 324-332)</cite> deals with how bills are written. This part of the Georgia Code (OCGA
        1-3-1)<sup><a href="#2">2</a></sup> is fairly straightforward and hardly controversial, as it sets standards for
        acceptable legislative language. Specifically, I'm going to quote (d)(4) through (d)(7) for context.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
        <p>(4) Gender. The masculine gender includes the feminine and the neuter.</p>
        <p>
          (5) Joint authority. A joint authority given to any number of persons of officers may be executed by a
          majority of them, unless it is otherwise declared.
        </p>
        <p>
          (6) Number. The singular or plural number each includes the other, unless the other is expressly excluded.
        </p>
        <p>(7) Tense. The present or past tense includes the future.</p>
        <p><cite>(OCGA 1-3-1(d)(4-7))</cite></p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>This looks complicated, but the gist of it is this:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>The gender being referred to here is grammatical gender.</li>
        <li>
          Subparagraph 4 says that if a bill uses words like "man" or "he," that does not mean women or anyone using
          they/them pronouns are exempt from that bill.
        </li>
        <li>Number here means if a bill says "a container," it could also mean "several containers."</li>
        <li>
          Including the future tense is there to ensure a defendant or legislator doesn't try something sneaky based on
          timeframes.
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        Grammatical gender is a phrase that's been used for decades, and it's hardly "woke." Justia has this section
        using the word gender as far back as 2006<sup><a href="#3">3</a></sup
        >, so it clearly isn't an issue. I remember learning about grammatical gender when I was learning Latin in high
        school. A word can't really have a sex since it's basically just shapes or sounds given social meaning. "Gender"
        is the correct word to use here.
      </p>
      <p>
        HB267 ignores this and strips the gender part of the definition out and replaces it with sex, along with a lower
        quality description of what that bit of the law means. It replaces "the masculine gender includes the feminine
        and the neuter" and replaces it with "masculine words shall include the feminine and the neuter"
        <cite>(HB267S, 332)</cite>. That just doesn't work as well and is lower in quality than the surrounding
        subparagraphs, making it look haphazard and rushed.
      </p>

      <h3 id="4-3">Section 4-3</h3>
      <p>
        Continuing on with definitions, Section 4-3 changes some of the definitions widely used throughout the Georgia
        Code. OCGA 1-3-3 contains the "default" definitions a word has in any bill unless another definition is
        included. This includes the heavily restrictive definitions of male and female as seen earlier, but it also
        includes this tidbit.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
        <p>
          (9.2) 'Man' means, except when used as a generic reference to human beings, an <em>adult</em> human male.
          [Emphasis added.]
        </p>
        <p>(11.1) 'Mother' means parent of the female sex.</p>
        <p>(22.1) 'Woman' means a human female.</p>
        <p><cite>(HB267, 260-263; HB267S, 343-346)</cite></p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
        The good faith interpretation of "adult" being missing from the definition of woman is that either Chairman
        Bonner or his legislative aide rushed this bill out and just forgot that very crucial word. If that was the
        case, I would have expected that language to be amended in the substitute. However, I am citing both the
        original bill and the substitute.
      </p>
      <p>
        The bad faith interpretation (something I'm far more willing to apply to lawmakers, especially of a bill this
        harmful) is that Chairman Bonner did this <em>intentionally.</em> While this doesn't get rid of the application
        of statutory rape for girls under the age of 16<sup><a href="#4">4</a></sup
        >, it's still incredibly concerning, especially as the word "adult" is included under the definition of man.
        This could open open the door to child marriage and age of consent fuckery. If <cite>Obergefell v Hodges</cite>
        was ever overturned, and we defined marriage as between a man and a woman, guess who qualifies as a woman now?
        That's right, everyone in Georgia assigned female at birth regardless of age! Even if it doesn't, this is still
        the old patriarchal idea of "women need to be protected from men by men" that has been absolutely rampant with
        these bills.
      </p>
      <p>
        I should note that multiple states have introduced language similar to this defining sex extremely
        restrictively, including Montana. Recently, a court in Montana overturned a similar law a second time, calling
        it unconstitutional and saying "Substituting the opinions of licensed medical professionals and individuals with
        that of the legislators’ own beliefs and values impermissibly requires Montanans to identify themselves based on
        the political ideology of legislators.<sup><a href="#5">5</a></sup
        >" If this bill passes, I would expect it would also be overturned on those grounds.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Important update!</strong> On Wednesday, February 26, this section was <em>removed</em> from the bill by
        the House Rules Committee before going to the floor for a vote Thursday. While this is a big win, I do expect
        this language to be reintroduced if it makes it to the Senate.
      </p>

      <h2>Sections 5-1 through 5-10 and 6-1</h2>
      <p>
        Part 5 is the most wide-ranging part of the bill, affecting far more of the Georgia Code than simply sports.
        Chairman Bonner has stated that this section aims to clean up the Code by removing all instances of "gender" and
        replacing them with "sex" or a related term like "sex terminology" when necessary. This includes sections on
        issuing hunting and fishing licenses <cite>(HB267S, 560-563)</cite>, prohibiting gender discrimination for
        school athletics <cite>(HB267S, 549-551)</cite>, and gathering census data on dentists specifically
        <cite>(HB276S, 587-588)</cite>. It's nothing more than an Orwellian desire to scrub unwanted words from the
        legal dictionary of this state.
      </p>
      <p>
        Despite this, that's not the most concerning section. Section 5-3 modifies OCGA 17-10-17<sup
          ><a href="#1">1</a> </sup
        >, the hate crime law that was passed in June 2020 to increase penalties for crimes found to be motivated by
        bias against the victim's "race, color, religion, national origin, sex, sexual orientation, gender, mental
        disability, physical disability." This bill removes the explicit protection of gender from the hate crime law
        <cite>(HB267S, 395)</cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Chairman Bonner said that he does not intend this bill to strip protections from anyone<sup
          ><a href="#6">6</a></sup
        >, and while it would make sense under his framework (as he doesn't think gender differs from sex whatsoever), I
        also just don't trust him to tell the truth here. This bill is part of a larger project to strip rights from
        queer Georgians under the guise of "protecting children." I do not have to take him seriously on this. And I
        didn't.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Important Update!</strong> During the (long) time spent writing this, Section 5-3 was removed before
        going to the full House for a vote. I fully expect this language to return to the bill once it goes to the
        Senate Education Committee.
      </p>
      <p>
        This whole section is annoying and insulting, and wholly unnecessary. The courts have had no issue interpreting
        what gender means for decades, and there certainly isn't a recent problem of judges tripping over these terms.
        This is only done to remove a dirty word that Chairman Bonner doesn't like.
      </p>

      <h2>Analysis</h2>
      <p>
        This bill is easily one of the most Orwellian, heavy-handed, invasive laws targeting transgender Americans that
        I have seen so far. The fact that it even got past the subcommittee meeting, much less get to a floor House vote
        on Thursday, February 27, is a sad reflection of how reactionary and cruel contemporary politics are to engage
        with. The surveillance of and retaliation against transgender people for trying to simply exist openly in
        broader society will continue to erupt with ever harsher bills and actions to deny us our dignity and our
        existence. This will not stop with HB267. This will not stop with SB248, a recently introduced bill to make
        telling a child your pronouns a crime. It will stop when conservatives lose, and they will lose.
      </p>
