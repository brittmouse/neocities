      <h1>The Trans Fight in Georgia: HB267, Part 1</h1>
      <time datetime="2025/02/22">February 22, 2025</time>

      <p>
        <a href="./the-ongoing-coup.html">Previously</a>, I said that I needed to become more involved with local
        politics and start participating in the process and representing myself. I decided this month that I was going
        to start real strong. I hopped onto the Legislative Action Support Team at my local PFLAG chapter as soon as I
        heard that it was a thing, and got a crash course in the Georgia legislative process, the bills of concern, and
        what we needed. At our first meeting on February 1, we were more worried about SB1 (sports ban), SB30 (youth
        transition care ban), SB36 ("Religious Freedom Restoration Act"), SB39 (state employee health insurance coverage
        ban for transition care), HB104 (sports ban), HB133 (mandated religious education), and SB61 (criminalizing
        children harshly).
      </p>
      <p>
        However, two weeks later, House Bill 267 &ndash; the Riley Gaines Act &ndash; was introduced. And it was far
        worse than the others we were worried about.
      </p>
      <p>
        For a breakdown of this bill, please visit <a href="./hb267-analysis.html">the companion post</a> that goes into
        the bill at length.
      </p>

      <h2>The Hearing</h2>
      <p>
        I got the news on February 18 that House Bill 267 was going to be heard in subcommittee the next day at 1:30 PM.
        Because this was scheduled so soon, I only got that alert well into the evening. Thankfully my manager is super
        understanding about how much all these anti-trans bills mean to me and let me go with a half day. So at lunch, I
        left, got Popeyes, and went down to the Capitol.
      </p>
      <p>
        The committee room was <em>crowded</em>. Because this bill is so contentious, the visitor section's pews were
        nearly full. Despite there only being 50 or so people on the pews, it took me a couple minutes to find my group,
        and I sat down next to a clump of people from SEIU before realizing they were right in front of me. I got
        settled in with them and I started setting up for taking notes. That's all I was going to do at first. The
        person next to me was live-skeeting the hearing, and a couple people next to me were also taking notes.
      </p>
      <p>
        Chairman Bonner, the sponsor of the bill, came up to present the bill in front of the House Education
        Subcommittee on Policy. He talked for a few minutes about how the bill was intended to level the playing field
        on women's sports, brought up the Riley Gaines incident<sup><a href="#1">1</a></sup
        >, and kept using the term "biological men." He also explained the broad scope of the bill's removal of "gender"
        from the Georgia Code as "clean up" and said that gender had not been defined in the code, and neither had sex.
        Despite not having a definition, Georgia courts have been able to interpret gender for at least two decades.
      </p>
      <p>
        After that, questions started. The two Democrats on the subcommittee were more skeptical of the bill, saying
        there were no carveouts for transgender people who had gone through medical transition for several years, asking
        about the logistics of designating bathrooms as for one sex or the other between separate sporting events held
        in the same venue, and how relevant this bill could be since the chairman was only referencing the one major
        media-grabbing incident. Republicans were in general praising the bill and not asking substantive questions.
      </p>
      <p>
        Then Bonner let the woman who'd been speaking into his ear thus far speak for herself. Riley Jones, a white
        blonde student athlete from UGA, talked about her time as a state champ for pole vaulting. She compared her
        record-breaking jump to those the men were doing: several feet higher and not breaking the men's records. While
        she did fine, she was characteristically transphobic, no more than Bonner was at any rate. But her being up
        there brought up some thoughts on race's importance to conservatism.
      </p>
      <p>
        During a ceremony Trump held to sign an executive order banning trans women from women's sports, he had a couple
        hundred women and girls standing behind him, smiling on. Besides the fact that someone so closely associated
        with Jeffrey Epstein shouldn't be that fucking close to children, there were all of two women of color in that
        entire crowd. The rest of them, Riley Gaines included, were white. It brought back to mind conservative
        opposition to the lifting of Jim Crow laws and the centuries-old fear of the purity of white women being
        tarnished by lesser social groups, whether they be African Americans, Latin Americans, or transgender people.
        Considering the other virulently racist rhetoric the Republican Party has and will continue to engage in, it
        does not surprise me that this is who showed up to be his guests.
      </p>
      <p>
        While Jones was talking, someone passed their phone around, asking anyone who wanted to testify to put their
        names on it. There are already seven or eight names on the list. I had never done testimony before. It was
        actually only my second time visiting the Gold dome, and all I had done last time was wander around and sit in
        on the SB1 votes in the Senate and then watch the Senate Rules Committee right after. I also didn't have my
        notepad with me to write things down on. Despite this, I got a feeling that I should give it a shot, even if I
        figured it would end horribly. So I put my name down, and dread slowly settled in over the course of the
        upcoming testimony.
      </p>

      <h2>Testimony</h2>
      <p>
        Testimony from the public is something you don't see on Capitol Hill in D.C. There's just too many people from
        all over the country to possibly hear all of that. Even if it were the case, it would still be too inconvenient
        for anyone with a normal job to make time to come down there, especially at the times congressmembers would
        schedule them. In Georgia, the public is allowed to give testimony for or against the bill, but only while the
        bill is being heard by a subcommittee. A bill in front of the full committee, or in front of the Rules
        Committee, or in front of the whole chamber, will not get any public comment. So subcommittees are one of the
        best times we have here in Georgia for making our voices heard on a bill.
      </p>
      <p>
        Because the committee room was packed and so many people (including myself, as the fear kept reminding me) were
        on the list to testify, Chairman Scott Hilton asked us to limit our time to four minutes apiece. It started with
        a doctor who handled gender-affirming care opposing the bill, talking about increase mental health risks and
        admonishing lawmakers for pursuing a bill that would hurt a vulnerable population. Next came someone from
        TransParent, also opposing the bill. Then came someone with a teacher's cadence, saying how she'd played with
        and against trans athletes and now taught her students to be kind. She opposed the bill. Next came a
        representative with Georgia Equality opposing the bill.
      </p>
      <p>
        This is about when the dread really settled in for me. These people were reading prepared statements; they were
        composed and straightforward. I was worrying that I would get up there and blue screen in front of everyone. But
        it was comforting to know that so many people were speaking out in support of the trans community and against
        this bill.
      </p>
      <p>
        The opposition kept coming too. The first transgender woman to compete in the Miss Georgia competition spoke
        about her struggles with gaining acceptance and how happy she was that ten other comptetitors were supportive of
        her identity. She left off by asking any Republican women in the room whether they were comfortable with their
        husbands sharing a bathroom with her. The gallery erupted with laughter at this barb at the Republican
        lawmakers, and the chairman had to cajole the meeting back into order. Crass, but absolutely worth it, since the
        testimony before and after this was pretty depressing.
      </p>
      <p>
        Next came some heated and emotional testimony against the bill from a survivor of sexual assault. She excoriated
        the lawmakers for targeting vulnerable children like this and refusing to solve actual problems targeting kids,
        like pedophile priests and unequal funding of kids' sports. While she was fairly loud, I could feel my throat
        closing up listening to her, getting emotional myself. Because of how long she went, the chairman limited
        testimony to three minutes. Next was a lawyer opposing the bill. I don't really remember what she said, because
        at this point my mind was fully consumed with practicing what I was going to say. One she was done, I stood up
        to take my place in line.
      </p>
      <p>
        After the lawyer was someone with my group, a former transgender student athlete (rowing), and an aide to
        Representative Doctor Jasmine Clark, one of the cooler Democrats in the House. She talked about what being able
        to participate in these sports meant to her and how much she would have lost out on if she had been banned. She
        hadn't made the news because "I just wasn't that good." She asked lawmakers to oppose the bill.
      </p>
      <p>
        Next was another trans woman who went through the bill in depth, criticizing some pieces while stumbling through
        a stutter. The chairman was patient with her though, so at least she was able to finish. She concluded with a
        comparison of the current bills being pushed and the lead-up to the Shoah which her grandparents survived. It's
        something I've also noticed over the past three years. She's not wrong to compare these policies to
        exterminationist campaigns carried out in the past, although due to the industrial character of the Shoah, I
        would have compared this more to the anti-trans violence in the lead-up to the mechanization of the mass murder
        or something like Armenia.
      </p>
      <p>When she finished and stepped away from the podium, it was my turn.</p>

      <h2>The Most Terrifying Three-and-a-half Minutes of my Life</h2>
      <p>
        I was easily the worst prepared person there. Other people testifying had experience from law school, previous
        testimonies, or public speaking and media training. All of them had a script or at least notes to go over.
        However, I had left my notepad at home, I <em>despise</em> taking notes on my phone, and I wasn't going to come
        up there with my Linux ThinkPad and read off of that because of how large it was compared to everyone else. I
        really shouldn't have been self-conscious about that, but in hindsight I think leaving the computer where I had
        been sitting was the right move, because instead of getting distracted by my desktop, I was only focused on not
        fucking up my message.
      </p>
      <p>
        Despite the comparative lack of experience, I wasn't without something to lean on. Because I got my degree in
        political science, I had literal years of experience giving presentations in front of classes. Usually these
        were just PowerPoints, but I applied that same need to over research something to this bill. That approach to
        research got me really far, putting me in an academic conference as a junior and aided both my senior thesis
        research and my internship with a professor. I kind of knew how to present, I knew which lines to bring up, and
        I had some idea of what I wanted to say.
      </p>
      <p>
        I started off by giving my name, my pronouns, and "I've been a lifelong Georgian all my life" within the first 5
        seconds. I was already feeling not having a presentation aide, the familiar jumble of thoughts requiring 80% of
        my brain to keep ordered. The first pieces of the bill I brought up were mostly nitpicks, but were chosen to
        illustrate that the bill was rushed and thrown together. First was the removal of "gender" and replacing of
        "sex" from OCGA 1-3-3 (see <a href="./hb267-analysis.html#4-3">"Section 4-3"</a>). I pointed out that this was
        referring to grammatical gender, not a trans thing, and that with how sex was defined in the bill, replacing
        gender with sex would be inappropriate. It wasn't particularly convincing or impactful though. Next I brought up
        how "man" was defined as "an adult human male" and "woman" was defined as "a human female." An oversight like
        that should have been caught by proofreaders, and I criticized Chairman Bonner directly for messing that up. I
        said that a bill this poorly written should not have been submitted in the first place.
      </p>
      <p>
        Next, I focused on the sports ban part of the bill. Bonner spoke over and over about this leveling the playing
        field, but this wasn't an issue affecting most Georgia students. Other trans athletes had spoken, and the reason
        the media didn't pick up on them is because they weren't that good. Importantly, both the actual effects of
        estrogen on the body and the experience of transition had been left out of the discussion thus far, so I brought
        them in.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
        <p>
          "No one out there is going to go through years of medical transition, social transition, putting up with
          bullies anywhere from the ages of 9 to 19, just to do a little bit better in something like a water polo
          match. It's an absurd claim to make that people are doing this to get an advantage at sports."
        </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
        There were quite a few stammers in there because I was coming up with stuff at the top of my head. Several times
        leading up to this I had to pause shortly to recollect myself. Plus my habit of pausing between every couple of
        words was acting up a lot from the stress. Despite this, I continued, talking about how trans women regularly
        experience a degradation of our biological advantages as we transition; while testosterone enhances muscle
        growth, estrogen does not, and combined with a testosterone blocker it drastically reduces the amount of
        testosterone being produced / received. This causes our muscles to weaken over time without proper exercise.
      </p>
      <p>
        After this, I tried making my final points, about how the bill was hodgepodged together, was widely out of touch
        with the needs of Georgians, and a massive overreach, but I stumbled very hard here. My brain was just refusing
        to come up with words and I was getting more flustered with each word I failed to communicate, eventually
        cascading into an awkward "Goodness gracious, my brain is not working right now" that Chairman Hilton gracefully
        responded to with some needed encouragement.
      </p>
      <p>"It takes a lot of courage to get up there. I appreciate what you're doing, you're doing a good job."</p>
      <p>"Thank you, especially with no script, I'm quite surprised."</p>
      <p>
        I got to laugh at myself some there, and thankfully others watching the testimony laughed with me. Even if
        Chairman Hilton wasn't on my side politically, he still said "It's impressive" while I was laughing, and it
        helped me enough to finish fairly strongly.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
        <p>
          "This bill, in short, is part of a larger project to strip all dignity and rights from transgender Georgians
          out of the law. This is not something I particularly appreciate as- we've haven't done anything to deserve
          this. Like, I sell used books. I don't see how this is some widespread issue when there's only one case where
          you can keep bringing up over and over and over again. Thank you."
        </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
        After this, I walked back from the podium and Hilton called the next person up. As I was going back to my seat,
        awkwardly smiling and thanking people who were congratulating me for what I thought was a lackluster
        performance, he made a point of empathizing with the people testifying. He was a chairman and he got nervous
        coming up to present bills at that podium. after sharing that, the person after me began to speak, and I paced a
        bit to blow off energy, as I was honestly itching to lie face down in the walkway and cry and explode in flames
        from the whole thing. I just said "Oseh shalom" over and over until I felt calm enough to properly sit down
        again.
      </p>
      <p>
        The "I sell used books" line was something I had been thinking for a while and it's my response whenever anyone
        asks me what my job is (because it's my job). It had been banging around for a while because this whole premise
        for the bill was that we were exceptional people that would hurt cis girls and women and needed to be protected
        against. I said that to insist on my dignity as a human being that participated in society, not in the fake
        scenarios conservatives were drumming up to restrict my rights. It had the unintended effect of making people
        even more impressed with my testimony, because here I was, some lower-class laborer, laying out specific lines
        in the bill with nothing in front of me to help me.
      </p>
      <p>
        More than anything, I wanted to get across that we deserved the dignity to live as ourselves, regardless of
        their personal feelings on our existence. I'm not sure I did a particularly good job, but it's something I'm
        going to continue insisting upon. Going in front of committees or up to legislators is difficult and sometimes
        degrading. Having to make an argument for my own rights is both degrading and intensely difficult, but it was
        absolutely worth it. I think on what I did every day since then, and while I would have changed a few things,
        the broad argument is still the same. I want my rights. I want respect under the law. I oppose anything that
        would take those from me.
      </p>

      <h2>Testimony, Continued</h2>
      <p>
        After I had sat down, another person came up in opposition to the bill. I was too busy calming down to hear
        anything she said. After her was a lawyer from the Alliance Defending Freedom, a right-wing think tank. You'd
        think someone from there was in favor of the bill, but she actually had some criticism about the protection of
        privacy in the sports ban sections. While there were paragraphs in the bill stressing that the law did not
        permit visual inspections of children's genitalia, it got some pushback over it not being an explicit ban. It
        looked like she'd be in favor of the bill if it had those protections, but losing the ADF as a conservative is
        really something you have to work for.
      </p>
      <p>
        Next was another trans woman from our group speaking in opposition. I was very proud of the group that had shown
        up to speak out for our own rights. While none of us were lawyers and few of us knew much about the laws in
        question (myself and Rep Clark's aide being two who did know), we still showed up as ourselves and I'm proud we
        did.
      </p>
      <p>
        The last member o the public to speak was Mike Griffin of the Georgia Baptists Mission Board. Given that he
        immediately cited scripture to justify the definitions of male and female in the bill, I was not at all
        surprised to hear he was in support. He was the only one I heard who explicitly came out in favor of the bill,
        which isn't surprising for someone associated with a organization covering up over 263,000 cases of sexual abuse
        from the Southern Baptist Convention.
      </p>
      <p>
        That wrapped up public testimony. The chairman called up someone from the minority party to testify,
        specifically Representative Park Cannon. She absolutely unloaded against the bill, saying it would institute the
        "panty police" and strip protections out of the hate crimes statute. She also cited my testimony on how estrogen
        affects transgender women's bodies, which made me really proud. All around, it was a great display of
        opposition. Over 10 opposed, 1 in favor, and I'm not sure where the ADF lawyer stood on it. Then Chairman Bonner
        spoke again, and the hearing went on with amendments and votes. One amendment was added to shorten some of the
        language by just pointing to another code section instead of repeating the same thing, and two were proposed but
        withdrawn for one reason or another.
      </p>
      <p>The bill passed along party lines, and I left with our group to figure out our next moves.</p>

      <h2>Was It Worth It?</h2>
      <p>
        It was absolutely worth it and I'm proud for having finally contributed to the fight against fascism in some
        very small way. Testimony is really difficult. Getting up and actually defending yourself in front of people who
        fundamentally believe you do not deserve rights is both insulting and motivating. It's worth getting angry over
        people refusing to respect your rights, because putting that into making people accept your dignity is the only
        way to gain it.
      </p>
      <p>Rights gifted are conditional. Rights fought for are not.</p>
