        <h1>On The Harris / Trump Debate</h1>

        <p>Note: Quotes are taken from the transcript of the debate <a
          href="https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/harris-trump-presidential-debate-transcript/story?id=113560542">here</a>.
          Emphasis added is mine.</p>

        <h2>A Brief Intro</h2>
        <p>At the time I'm writing this, the United States is in the final two months of the 2024 presidential election,
          and we are a week out from our first (maybe only) debate between the two main presidential candidates. Vice
          President Kamala Harris (D-CA) and former president Donald Trump (R-FL) both went to Philadelphia to make
          their case as to why they should be president of the United States and not their opponent. My mind was made up
          well before this but I still wanted to judge how well Harris would do in a debate against someone who has
          usually looked strong on the stage, as well as get a look into her actual policies into how she would handle
          climate change, energy independence (and whether that's even the best solution), foreign policy, and
          restraining large corporations.</p>
        <p>What I got instead was a little policy, a lot of sniping at Trump from Harris, and a lot of Trump stabbing
          himself in the dick. And some of the best laughs I've had this year.</p>

        <h2>Performance</h2>
        <p>I was anxious ahead of the debate over how well Harris would do against Trump. He's a very belligerent
          debater that likes dragging opponents. Clinton fell for it <em>hard</em> in 2016, and Biden was a victim of
          this in the previous presidential debate before he dropped out. But Harris surprisingly didn't. She was
          nervous starting off and immediately irked me by pivoting to a rehearsed stump speech instead of answering a
          basic question about whether Americans were better off today than they were 4 years ago (generally yes but
          it's complicated). Despite that start, she got much better as the night went on, landing some good hits on
          Trump's ego but still refraining from any strong policy statements.</p>
        <p>Not like she needed to with how Trump acted. Much of it was his old standard rambling, whining, and lying,
          but there were some egregious failures. He was asked whether he had a plan on replacing the Affordable Care
          Act and replied "I have concepts of a plan." He went on a strange rant about how Haitian immigrants in
          Springfield, Ohio were "eating the dogs [...] they're eating the cats, they're eating &ndash; they're
          <em>eating</em> the <em>pets</em> of the people that live there." He said Harris "wants to do transgender
          operations on illegal aliens that are in prison." He was especially bizarre.</p>
        <p>It was even harder to get any policy positions out of Trump because he kept bringing it back to
          fear-mongering over illegal immigration (not like Republicans want Latin Americans or Africans /
          Afro-Caribbeans coming in legally anyways). You might be able to tease out some policy positions but it was
          delivered so strangely that it was nearly impossible to make it out. It just didn't make much sense.</p>
        <p>Harris really got him on his ego though. She got several digs in at him over the size and attendance of his
          rallies, how he only got his real estate empire because of his father's wealth and not form any talent on his
          part, and how he'd been fired by 81 million people. The petulant, angry way he responded to each of these,
          wasting valuable time on talking about how big his rallies are instead of actual policy (or just ignoring the
          topic at hand to fear-monger over the millions of "illegals" pouring in). Harris used his ego perfectly and was
          able to use his response to deflect from the times she refused to give any policy specifics or dodge hard
          questions.</p>

        <h2>Policy, Policy, Policy: What is it Good For?</h2>
        <p>Both candidates positioned themselves as continuations of their past. Trump made reference over and over
          again to how good "his" economy was, how America was strong on the world stage, and how he was going to clamp
          down further on the border. Harris instead brought up some of the good things the Biden administration has
          accomplished over the past 3-and-a-half years, like the increased child tax credit, investing one trillion
          into clean energy, and supporting Ukraine with military aid.</p>
        <p>However, when pushed on the negatives of their policies, or on their inconsistency, both dodged in their own
          ways. Trump would talk about how the numbers were faked or how it was fantastic, actually. Harris usually
          either dodged into a stump speech or tried to spin it in a good way. That may have been for the best as a
          debate strategy, as it saved her from having to explain complicated topics like supply-chain logistics,
          monetary policy, and the concepts of deterrence and strategic ambiguity to the most foolish demographic G-d
          ever created: the median voter. Getting a lecture in political science or economics is not something that wins
          over voters; vibes and "looking right" gets more median voters. However, there are questions I believe you
          <em>should</em> own and answer honestly.</p>

        <h3>Economics: The Worst Social Science</h3>
        <p>Harris didn't give a good answer on whether Americans were better off four years ago than they were now.
          I think we are, but "better" and "good" are two different ideas. Four years ago, we were in the midst of the
          COVID pandemic and protests over police brutality and racism. Four years ago we were at the peak of the second
          rise of COVID cases and deaths, averaging over 100k cases per day<sup><a href="#1">1</a></sup> and nearly 2000
          deaths per day<sup><a href="#2">2</a></sup>. Four years ago (September 2020) the unemployment rate was 7.8
          percent<sup><a href="#3">3</a></sup>. In many ways the economy is better, but better is not good, and "good"
          is defined by the median voter as "I can afford groceries and my rent / mortgage." And that has been far more
          difficult for the past several years for many reasons, including supply chain squeezes leaving years-long
          knots in the system (especially when dealing with the nightmare that is the international shipping industry),
          increased consumer demand, changing fiscal habits from work from home (citation needed), and corporate greed.
          It's difficult to explain all this to voters because a) it's very technical and doesn't make for a good story,
          and b) the median voter doesn't give a damn about "Congressional deadlock" or "forces outside the White
          House's control", they think the president can just do anything.</p>
        <p>Trump played off that ignorance when she did pitch her policy positions. He responded multiple times to
          Harris' policies with "she's been vice president for three-and-a-half years and she hasn't done it yet." Her
          policies on the economy are decent but lacking. She wants a $6000 child tax credit, a $4000/family raise
          compared to current levels, and a $50k tax deduction to new small businesses. She said some vague things about
          bringing down prices on housing and food but there was very little in the specifics. Despite these incredibly
          vague promises, Trump both said "She's going to my philosophy now" and "She's a Marxist" within the same
          paragraph.</p>
        <p>Trump used those attacks to play up his flat 20% tariff on <em>every good we import</em>. If you'll remember,
          Trump implemented heavy tariffs during his term that interfered heavily with free trade with our neighbors and
          with the larger global economy. This lead to retaliatory tariffs being places on U.S. goods, including China
          placing a large tariff on American agricultural products, cutting the revenue from American agricultural trade
          to China in half<sup><a href="#4">4</a></sup>. The general economy also suffered, with higher prices being
          passed onto American consumers <sup><a href="#5">5</a></sup> <sup><a href="#6">6</a></sup>. Having a flat
          tariff on every single import would directly translate to higher prices for consumers, since countries
          exporting goods to the U.S. would pass that cost off to importers, and importers would pass that cost off onto
          consumers.</p>

        <h3>Energy</h3>
        <p>Harris supports a move away from fossil fuels but still takes the national security / economic protectionist
          stance of continuing to produce fossil fuels to become a net exporter of oil and gas. This makes sense from a
          national security and economic standpoint as oil is a valuable commodity that can fuel civilian and military
          production. Making America a net exporter might allow us to join the Organization of Petroleum Exporting
          Countries (OPEC), giving us a lot more influence over global oil prices and competing with Russia and Saudi
          Arabia in an arena where we've usually been the target, not a dealmaker.</p>
        <p>This would also mean continued profits for petro-barons and further commitment to a system of energy
          production that we know is causing climate change. She didn't even mention alternative / clean energy sources
          during her answer; she simply stated "I won't ban fracking" and "We need to invest in diverse sources of
          energy."</p>
        <p>Trump blamed Harris for causing high oil prices, something that I really doubt anyone in the government can
          really mess with much. It is funny that when prices go up it's the government, and when prices go down it's
          the economy. He said he'd do way more fracking and said solar was bad but that he also liked solar.</p>
        <p>I'm disappointed with Harris' answer. Only mentioning "diverse sources of energy" once feels like a major
          snub of environmentalist groups and to everyone dead from last year's major natural disasters. I expected bad
          from Trump but I'm more annoyed at Harris. Perhaps she was just keeping that quiet as the question was about
          whether her values had changed over whether fracking was good and not what her energy policy was specifically,
          but I'm still annoyed.</p>

        <h3>Foreign Policy</h3>
        <p>When asked if she believed she bore any responsibly for the chaotic withdrawal out of Afghanistan, Harris
          said "I agreed with President Biden's decision to pull out of Afghanistan." That certainly is not a simple
          "yes" or "no," but saying "I agreed with the decision" does suggest you take responsibility for the
          consequences of that decision. It isn't decisive but it wasn't Biden's "they [the Afghan National Army] did
          not have the resolve to fight,"<sup><a href="#7">7</a></sup> which in my opinion completely abdicates
          responsibility. Harris did use the question to criticize Trump for bypassing the government of Afghanistan
          entirely to negotiate directly with the Taliban, including inviting them to <em>Camp David</em>. If Obama had
          done that, it would have taken the entire 1st Armored Division to keep people from burning down the White
          House.</p>
        <p>Harris reiterated her support for Israel, for a ceasefire and hostage deal (something neither party of the
          Israel-Hamas war seems interested in, especially Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu), and for a
          two-state solution, which may be entirely out of the question now. She also reiterated her support for
          Ukraine's war against Russian aggression, without saying whether she would be in favor of letting Ukraine hit
          military targets deeper inside Russia with American munitions. It was the normal liberal answer I would expect
          from a boring Democrat.</p>
        <p>Trump meanwhile claimed these wars never would have happened if he was president (1. specious reasoning, 2.
          bullshit) due to how strong he is. He has this weird idea that just by looking tough, he can get other
          countries to do what he wants, which worked really well to deter Iran from getting nuclear weapons and funding
          international terrorism. I call this the "whip your dick out to assert dominance" school of international
          relations theory. Works great, right until you drive a hammer into it, as strong, stupid men frequently
          do.</p>
        <p>(I'll have to write some about the state of American foreign policy analysis in the future, but in the
          meantime <a href="https://youtu.be/ajEOT5ptTdw">here's Sarcasmitron's excellent video on the topic</a>.)</p>
        <p>Trump's answer on Ukraine was bad. When asked "Do you want Ukraine to win this war?" he responded "I want this
          war to end." Insisting that Ukraine negotiate with Russia without mentioning any specifics essentially means
          that Ukraine should accept at least giving up Crimea, probably also Luhansk and Donetsk Oblasts, and
          potentially Zaporizhzhya and Kherson Oblasts. Calling for "negotiation" when the U.S. is not the country being
          invaded or bombed suggests either personal interest in Russia dominating and controlling eastern Ukraine or a
          general disregard for the well-being of those residing outside your borders, either of which Trump and Vance
          could fit.</p>
        <p>I'm less interested in the China stuff. They both tried to out-strong the other and none of it was that
          convincing. China would be less of a threat if "anti-war" movements like the LaRouchians would stop convincing
          everyone they're already at war.</p>

        <h2>Post-Debate Ramifications</h2>
        <p>Springfield, Ohio has been reeling from the past week of racist and exterminationist rhetoric. Republicans
          are openly lying and completely fine with it. There have been bomb threats called to schools and government
          buildings. The migrants have been called "cockroaches," rhetoric ripped right from the start of the Rwandan
          Genocide. Republican politicians are calling for anywhere from 11 to 25 million people to be deported, a
          population transfer that would dwarf the massive humanitarian disasters in Syria, the Democratic Republic of
          the Congo, and Sudan. It would require a surveillance and logistical network dwarfing the state Hitler created
          to hunt down Jews, Romani, and Slavs.</p>
        <p>Harris had a pretty good night and a lot of energy behind her campaign. I think her recent interview with the
          National Association of Black Journalists was a big letdown. She again showed she isn't willing to answer the
          actual questions that voters have by throwing around numbers like they mean anything instead of giving us a
          narrative to rally people around. She isn't even talking about raising the minimum wage! It's depressing and
          insulting that she gives so little effort to answering questions people actually have.</p>
        <p>My choice was made up years ago. Republicans were and still are exterminationist when it comes to trans and
          gay people, non-white people, and political opponents. Jill Stein of the Green Party can't call Putin a war
          criminal and doesn't know how many voting members of the House of Representatives there are. I disagree with
          the Party for Socialism and Liberation on nearly every single foreign policy position they have (long live the
          State Department). I'm voting for Harris.</p>
        <p>But it was absolutely worth watching that debate. Aside from Trump's incredible gaffs and Harris' great
          performance, it was at least worth it to remind myself how nuts the former president is and how easy it is to
          insult him. I felt sane for a little bit. Granted, an entire week has passed and about a year's worth of news
          occurred so I'm no longer mentally sound, but it was nice while it lasted.</p>
