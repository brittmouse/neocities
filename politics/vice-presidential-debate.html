      <h1>On The Walz / Vance Debate</h1>
      <time datetime="2024/10/03">October 3, 2024</time>
      <p>First, a <em>Shana Tova</em> to everyone, as it's Rosh Hashanah, the start oaf the Jewish year, and we're now
        in the year 5785. I pray it's better than the last.</p>
      <p>Second, this is going to be shorter than the <a href="./presidential-debate.html">presidential debate
        overview</a> because that took far too long to write and I'm not interested in going that deep.</p>

      <h2>The Debate</h2>
      <p>I think Walz did a good job despite his inexperience with the national stage, but if we were going off just how
        professional each candidate came off as, I think Vance won. He clearly embodied the stuck-up, elitist young
        lawyer who can get you out of a sticky lawsuit or criminal charge, or a smooth talking autodealer. Now, due to
        my own biases against both lawyers and Ivy League students, I interpret that as "awful human being."</p>
      <p>Proving my point, Vance lied constantly. He lied about Trump's economic record, he lied about Trump's
        immigration plans, and he lied about the January 6th Capitol insurrection. Walz called him out consistently for
        this, especially Vance's refusal to say whether Trump lost the 2020 presidential election. It showed to me that
        the Republican Party is too far gone to be trusted to exist in a participatory government. When half of the
        political spectrum is convinced that elections aren't fair and that they should take extralegal (read, illegal)
        steps in order to win, your political system is fucked.</p>
      <p>Vance's willingness and ability to launder Trump's lies through a more respectful lens is troubling, as it
        shows a "professionalization" of fascist tendencies of the Trump-era GOP. Combined with Democrats for some
        god-forsaken reason adopting Republican stances on immigration and tariffs as soon as Trump was out of office,
        and it doesn't indicate a strong future for the political left inside the Democratic Party, insofar as that
        future was strong in the first place. May neoliberalism rot.</p>
