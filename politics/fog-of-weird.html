      <h1>The New President and the Fog of Weird</h1>
      <time datetime="2025/01/22">January 22, 2025</time>

      <h2>How We Feeling, Chat?</h2>
      <p>Bad. The answer is bad.</p>
      <p>I'm just so damn tired.</p>
      <p>Basically, I've been utterly exhausted since 7 October 2023. I haven't been out protesting or putting up signs
        or waving flags around. I've been watching the American Left back a right-wing terrorist group for over a year
        and shout absolutely heinous antisemitic rhetoric. I've had to watch Israel flatten the Gaza Strip and (just
        recently) launch a major incursion into Jenin in the West Bank, killing at least 9 so far.<a href="#1"><sup>1</sup></a> I don't see rhetoric
        drawing a line between support for civilians and support for either military. Despite the growing voices for a
        real peace, the loudest ones are activists intensely angry at the other side.</p>
      <p>Also, Trump is president again, and wow the fascism is on full display. Media corporations are already
        censoring themselves and their users. Trump has defined every transgender person out of existence (by
        accidentally defining everyone as "female"). He launched a goddamn memecoin that was briefly worth $70 billion
        on 19 January.</p>

      <h2>What the Fuck is Happening Anymore?</h2>
      <p>The "uncanny feeling" I've been feeling over 2024 is particularly strong now, and I've seen this with other
        people. Nothing feels real and because I'm not the only person experiencing this, that just has me more worried.
        I barely have any idea what's going on anymore.</p>
      <p>I can still think the actual circumstances through and try interpreting them but none of it makes much sense.</p>

      <h3>Fascism and Capital accumulation</h3>
      <p>The answer I've seen bounced around a lot in left-wing circles, from the DSA to Vaush, is that this is the
        result of the long slide towards fascism and the accumulation of capital among the ruling class throwing their
        support behind it. This makes sense through the Marxist framework, as the ruling class stands to gain more money
        and power throwing their support behind the man who says he's going to make things much better for big business.
        The Biden administration was emphatically fighting against corporate mergers like those between Kroger and
        Albertson's grocery store chains and the anti-monopoly attacks against Google. Big tech especially saw this and
        decided they would have more chanced for money hoarding with a fascist in charge.</p>
      <p>Marxist analysis does lack somewhat in explaining why the working and middle classes went along with it though.
        There's the "class reductionist" perspective, which sacrifices all nuance of the situation into class analysis
        by saying "This was a deliberate move by the ruling class's control over media to bring a fascist into power
        that would be good for their wallets." However, I believe this overlooks the media environment split among the
        poor and the young especially. No one watches NBC or CBS. Old boomers watch Fox News and MSNBC plenty, and they
        usually have the highest turnouts in elections. The young (which I'm defining here as 18-29) went largely for
        Harris but only made up 13 percent of the vote.<a href="#2"><sup>2</sup></a> That's below even the 30-39
        turnout.</p>
      <p>The gender split between Gen Z men and women is also stark, and has been commented on plenty in the past
        several months. This is largely due to what kinds of alternative media young voters are consuming, and I think
        that may also be the influence around the Fog of Weird that's permeating everything.</p>

      <h3>Fog of Weird</h3>
      <p>I've bounced back and forth on what to call this: a mass unreality / derealization event, the fallout of
        post-irony, the long-COVID effect. November Kelly of <em>TrashFuture</em> and <em>Well, There's Your
          Problem</em> has been calling this the "Years of Lead Poisoning," which is pretty good but largely focuses on
        the spat of right-wing terror attacks this past year, probably to set off the Boogaloo. I'm calling it the Fog
        of Weird.</p>
      <p>The Fog of Weird is this persistent, widely felt feeling of nothing making any sense and everything feeling
        fake and wrong. Everything is self-contradicting, insincere, and cheap. Everything's a scam, there's no hope of
        getting ahead, advertisements are insultingly stupid and worthless, politics has stopped making sense, and
        trying to comprehend any of the international politics out there is like trying to lasso a swarm of hornets.</p>
      <p>It's a stark separation between reality as it is being perceived and what reality is supposed to be.</p>
      <p>Remember the panic over drones in New Jersey? How you had loads of people seeing red and green lights in the
        sky and panicking over being surveilled by Chinese drones? Remember how there were people demanding a federal
        investigation into the constellation Orion, that big guy we see in the fall and winter in the Northern
        Hemisphere? You know how it just stopped one day and we never heard about it again? That is a manifestation of
        the Fog of Weird.</p>
      <p>I'm not sure what's really behind the Fog of Weird. It's just something I've noticed getting worse and worse
        over the past year and it shows no signs of letting up. It truly feels as though we've entered the Twilight
        Zone. I'm not sure how this started but I'm not liking its effects.</p>

      <h2>"Is It Just a Me Thing?" Asked Everyone You Know</h2>
      <p>I've considered this just being a me feeling for a while but I'm certain this is being widely felt. I've talked
        with my manager about this feeling a couple of times and he's felt the same thing. Talking with some friends has
        yielded the same results. Everything just feels <em>off</em>.</p>
      <p>This could be anything from long COVID effects, the exhaustion of the past year, or just work stress getting to
        everyone. But I also wonder about what mental illnesses I'm dealing with. Being trans with depression and
        anxiety is already a cocktail of suffering, but I'm certain it's worse than just that for me. I've been handling
        this without meds or therapy for years, just relying on what small self-care stuff I know and leaning heavily on
        my friends. It's not a great way to do it and I wouldn't recommend doing it this way in the slightest.</p>
      <p>We're in for a rough 2 years at least, probably <em>far</em> worse in the foreseeable future. The climate
        crisis spins on; tech CEOs become feudal lords of the World Wide Web with AI-assisted surveillance and more data
        collection; products are made worse, made to spy on you, and made by more impoverished workers; the liberal
        international order that held a semblance of peace together for decades is dying in Ukraine, Gaza, and Taiwan;
        drug use snared another generation of lonely, desperate young people.</p>
      <p>I <a href="./election-2024.html">said</a> back in November that we all had to live. I was right and I'm still
        going to do that. But <em>fuck me</em> this is discouraging. I'm going to be retreating into this website a lot,
        which means I probably need to do a reskin of this site. I'm also going to be doing the small things I can do to
        make the end of it all a little sweeter. Running stream for my temple, trying out Jekyll for a new county
        interfaith alliance website, volunteering and helping others. I doubt the Fog of Weird is going to lift anytime
        soon, or if nuclear detonations are going to blow it all clear.</p>
      <p>Just make sure to do something that the Fog can't get into. Running this site has helped a lot with my head and
        even if Neocities goes, I'll make this site come back. Let each breath I take and each day this stays active
        revive a spark of resistance in my heart and kindle the love in my soul.</p>
