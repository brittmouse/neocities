      <h1>You Need to Live: What Harris' Loss Means</h1>
      <time datetime="2024/11/07">November 7, 2024</time>

      <p>When I woke Tuesday morning, I was ready. I was ready for Trump to get handed a massive L. I was ready to see
        him bitch and moan about how rigged the election was. I was ready for a days-long fight to determine who was
        going to get Georgia.</p>
      <p>When I went to a watch party at my old college, I was the most confident person at the table. I regularly told
        others to calm down as the night had just started and there wasn't a reason to be worried about Indiana going
        for Trump or 3000 votes being split 2-1 two minutes after polls close. Frankly the most annoying part of the
        night was trying to bank Monopoly.</p>
      <p>When I went home, I left seeing Trump up about a hundred points in the electoral college but ultimately
        believing that Harris would come back and win Georgia, Pennsylvania, and the rest of the Sun Belt.</p>
      <p>When I woke up, Trump had won.</p>

      <h2>Where Harris Went Wrong</h2>
      <p>I agree whole-heartedly with Senator Bernie Sanders on this. The Democratic Party has completely lost the plot.
        There was hardly any connection between the top-level of the campaign and organizers on the ground, much less
        with voters. Harris fundamentally refused to distance herself from Joe Biden and his economy. The median voter
        doesn't understand monetary policy, supply chains, and interest rates. They don't even understand that the
        Inflation Reduction Act reduced inflation faster than any other G7 country.</p>
      <p>That didn't matter.</p>
      <p>The Democratic Party decided to stick with neoliberalism, stick with institutionalism, stick to their guns and
        figure out later which way the pieces fell. They completely rejected populism, completely rejected any ideas to
        actually improve the working man's plight, and instead decided to get really technical and nerdy. I say this
        from personal experience, sounding like an annoying nerdy shit does not help in an argument. Everyone hates you
        for it.</p>
      <p>Was this a campaign problem? Not really. Democrats got a lot more canvassers and organizers but it didn't
        matter. Trump found a <em>lot</em> of support from young men through alternative right-wing media outlets. No
        one watches NBC. People get their news through livestreamers like Vaush or podcasts. While public radio has a
        big following, it doesn't compare in effectiveness to conservative talk radio.</p>
      <p>The problem is ideological. Democrats are fundamentally liberals and institutionalists. They are not
        socialists, not populusts, and not anti-capitalists. They completely refused to treat (admittedly very dumb)
        American voters with anything but "disappointed mother" energy. If Harris had said at least once that she would
        have gone far harder again the rich or that she would have scrapped big business handouts, that might have
        gotten her a bit more attention. The overly technical language drove people off. The unwillingness to change
        damn near anything drove people off. And to some extent, her being a woman drove people off.</p>

      <h2>Trans Survival</h2>
      <p>I won't lie, I'm fairly scared about how bad this is going to get for transgender Americans for the next
        few years. We've been the target of the American culture war for about three years now and while it slowed down
        for a few months, it's going to get much worse.</p>
      <p>As I wrote <a href="./anti-trans-1.html">here</a>, Republicans decided to make trans women and drag queens a
        major attack vector against Kamala Harris and other Democrats this election. There were constant ads about
        doctors performing sex changes on minors, boys playing in girls' sports, and illegal immigrants being forced
        into gender reassignment surgeries. Even before these ads, we had two years of constant shit-slinging, from
        state representatives calling transgender people "demons and imps" to stating our very existence is pornographic
        (goes to show what they were watching).</p>
      <p>Electing Harris to the presidency and getting a majority in both houses of Congress wouldn't have stopped these
        attacks or solved our larger fundamental issues, but they would at least have hopefully stopped the worst of
        these bills from coming to pass. A Democratic Congress likely would not have put the effort into protecting
        trans rights in states like Texas, Florida, or Montana. But they most likely wouldn't have implemented national
        versions of these hateful laws.</p>
      <p>We don't get that protection now.</p>
      <p>While states like New York, Minnesota, and Washington are going to be safe refugee states, the national outlook
        is very bleak. Just look at GOP attempts to regulate contraceptive medications through the Comstock Act or
        national attempts by Marjorie Taylor Greene, Matt Gaetz, and others to ban all federal funding for
        gender-affirming care. The rage I felt when multiple rider amendments were introduced to the National Defense
        Authorization Act of 2024 (NDAA24) that tried to ban all TRICARE coverage for service members that were trans or
        who had transgender family like spouses or kids was palpable. It was unjust, unfair, and cruel.</p>
      <p>That is all of us in a few months. It is going to be an absolute shitshow.</p>

      <h3>Hope and Spite</h3>
      <p>I'm angry. I'm angry at Republicans for using us a culture war battle for years. I'm angry at Democrats for not
        showing up. I'm angry at the DNC for trying to ignore their way into four more years of power. I'm angry at
        Hillary Clinton for thinking that the right approach to trans right for the Democratic Party was to throw us
        under the bus. I'm mad at people like Colin Allred of Texas and Sherrod Brown of Ohio for ditching us as soon as
        a bit of dirt was thrown at them over not calling for our suppression. I'm mad that Harris did damn near nothing
        to support transgender Americans through the worst attacks we've felt in years. I'm mad that Joe Scarborough of
        super-communist network MSNBC immediately threw us under the bus over a completely warped view of what being
        trans in sports is like.</p>
      <p>If nothing else, I am going to continue living through this out of spite. The idea that Trump, Vance,
        Scarborough, or those ghouls at the Heritage Foundation get to live on after I'm dead is sickening, and I am not
        going to take that. I will outlive McConnell. I will outlive Trump. I will outlive Biden. I will outlive
        Sanders. I have to live.</p>
      <p>But as choking as this fog is now, I won't lose sight of what's important. None of us can.</p>
      <p>At the Jewish Reform temple I go to, there's three Torahs. Two live in the Ark, lovingly wrapped and carried
        around for people to bring their tzitzit and siddurs to touch. The third lives, opened, behind a glass case.
        That Torah was written in the 1890s in Europe. It was smuggled out of Europe during the Holocaust, the single
        worst oppression Jews have ever faced. The idea that a scroll so large can be smuggled away from the hands of
        destructive forces to safety is a testament of many things. It's a testament to the will of humanity to refuse
        to die. It's a testament to the will of the Jews to refuse to die. It's a testament to those who knew the risks
        of what they did and did them anyways.</p>
      <p>It is also, ultimately, a testament to the luck that sustains and destroys us. Many Torah scrolls were burned
        during the 1930s and 1940s in Germany, France, Poland, Austria, Czechoslovakia, Hungary, Yugoslavia, and
        Lithuania. While we know the names of those who survived the Holocaust, there are millions more whom we do not
        know. I shudder wondering who we already lost in the past two days. My heart breaks for those who are choosing
        to return to or remain in the closet over these fears. They are very valid fears, and I only wish we lived in a
        world where we could be ourselves, authentically. More than a quarter of all transgender kids have attempted
        suicide in the past year. How many more succeeded and were miscounted by their parents and the state? A
        community near and dear to my heart lost someone to suicide earlier this year. We're already struggling. How
        much more can any of us take anymore?</p>
      <p>No matter what, we will persist. I see that Holocaust Torah and I see hope. I see trans women in their sixties
        and I see hope. We have to be that for the next generation. We have to keep this fight up. We cannot die now. We 
        do not deserve to die now. None of us should die at 16 years old, harassed by school mates and teachers until
        life lost all its luster and we took our lives. None of us should die at 20, beaten by skinheads or cops for
        defending our rights on the streets. None of us should die at 25, drifting into the darkness as the poison slows
        our hearts, lifesaving drugs sabotaged. None of us should die at 28, malnourished and out on the street.</p>
      <p>We deserve to live. You deserve to live. You have to live. I know it looks impossible but it absolutely isn't.
        Bush won in 2004. Gay rights were pushed back over a decade. But we still won that. Trans kids, both living and
        yet to join us, deserve to know there's a future beyond early adulthood. We have to carry on for each other and
        for everyone to come.</p>

      <h2>Rest</h2>
      <p>For the rest of this week, rest. I beg of you, rest. Turn the news and politics off for a month. Get your
        affairs in order. Get a passport. Keep in touch with everyone. Be active in local orgs. Just be around a
        community that loves you. Please rest. Pace yourself. Keep loving each other. That's all I ask.</p>
      <p>To life.</p>
