      <h1>The Trans Fight in Georgia: HB267</h1>
      <time datetime="2025/02/22">February 22, 2025</time>

      <h2>Keeping My Word</h2>
      <p>
        <a href="./the-ongoing-coup.html">Previously</a>, I said that I needed to become more active and make sure that
        I was representing myself in state and local politics. This past week, I've been able to do just that. I've been
        down to the Gold Dome again this week to watch the House Education Policy Subcommittee discuss HB267. This is a
        significant anti-trans bill introduced to the Georgia House that would ban transgender student athletes from
        participating on sport teams that match their gender identity and strip "gender" as a protected category under
        the Georgia hate crime law <a
          href="https://law.justia.com/codes/georgia/title-17/chapter-10/article-1/section-17-10-17/">(OCGA
          17-10-17(b))</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Because bills are dense and I'm going to be including lots of citations, I am including PDF files of both <a
          class="pdf" href="./attachments/HB267_LC-49-2204.pdf">the bill as introduced</a> and <a class="pdf"
          href="./attachments/HB267_SUB_LC-49-2270S.pdf">the bill as amended</a> after going through the House
        Education Policy Subcommittee. For simplicity, I'm going to be citing these as HB267 and HB267S (for
        "substitute") respectively; if I were to point to line 42 of the original bill, I would cite it as <cite>(HB267,
          42)</cite>.
