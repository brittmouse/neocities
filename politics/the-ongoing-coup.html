      <h1>An Ongoing Coup</h1>
      <time datetime="2025/02/16">February 16, 2025</time>

      <h2>Controlled Crazy</h2>
      <p>
        The past weeks since the inauguration of Donald Trump as President of the United States have tested every
        guardrail the American system of government is supposed to have. Trump has impounded federal funding allocated
        by Congress, flagrantly violating the Impoundment Control Act of 1974 (back when Nixon tried to do this same
        thing). He's cracked down on undocumented immigrants as strongly as he claimed he would, shifting his rhetoric
        from "split families" to "deport all of them, including American citizens," trying to roll back <em>birthright
          citizenship</em> which has existed since the 14th Amendment's adoption in 1868. Elon Musk has been aiding in
        Trump's endeavour to "shake up" the federal government by installing incredibly young loyalists in agencies like
        the Department of State, Treasury, and Energy. Musk's push to "get rid of waste, fraud, and abuse" (an old
        Republican talking point that frames any funding they don't like as inherently criminal) resulted in shutdowns
        of key programs like SNAP, farmers' subsidies, and USAID.
      </p>

      <h3>Economic Policy: Fucking up the Money</h3>
      <p>
        On American economic policy, he's decided the best way to lower prices for American consumers is get into
        trade wars with fucking everyone. Tax half our oil imports from Canada another 10%, tax the lumber and steel
        coming in from Canada at 25%, tax cars made in Mexico by 25%, and levy additional tariffs against Chinese steel
        on top of those already in place. All this is going to do is raise prices for Americans. At a time where egg
        prices are rising to over $7/dozen because of avian flu sweeping Georgia, this is a phenomenal way to cause the
        recession you (presumably) want to avoid.
      </p>
      <p>
        It doesn't even make sense from a basic economics perspective. The reason America buys stuff like Canadian
        steel and lumber, Japanese cars from Mexican factories, and Venezuelan oil, is because it's good business sense
        for American companies. The American government isn't purchasing Chinese steel. American companies are because
        it's cheaper (both in price and, I expect, quality). We don't cast our own steel as much because it doesn't
        offer us a comparative advantage anymore. If we buy more steel from China or Canada, we can let their citizens
        have (hopefully) well-paying foundry jobs while we use that steel to fund better paying jobs like machinists,
        designers, etc. A rich man doesn't need to mend his own suit &ndash; he can pay a tailor. He doesn't need to
        grow his own crops or build his own televisions.
      </p>
      <p>
        It's incredible that the political party that has spent the most time out of anyone talking about "basic
        economics" and lionizing Adam Smith (honestly not a bad theorist) is giving up basic economic theory for
        grug-level nationalism.
      </p>

      <h3>Foreign Policy: Fucking up Our Prestige</h3>
      <p>
        Trumps foreign policy is frustratingly stupid. On Wednesday, February 12, Trump announced he had completely
        skipped over Ukrainian president Zelenskyy to talk to Russian president Putin first about ending the
        Russo-Ukrainian War; this is almost the single worst move you could possibly make on a strategic level besides
        just nuking Moscow. It pisses off literally every single ally in NATO, especially the hint that the U.S. won't
        respond to Article V requests from European member-states. Kremlin-aligned media figures without Russia were
        literally grinning over how easy Trump has been to manipulate. Getting rid of USAID entirely (an independent
        foreign aid agency) is insultingly stupid, as it's one of the most cost-effective ways of influencing our
        relationship with foreign countries, especially in Africa where we have been woefully behind
        relationship-building compared to Russia and China.
      </p>
      <p>
        There's barely a pursuit of American interests on the world stage now. What does the United States gain letting
        Russia conquer Ukrainian territory? How do we benefit from getting entangled in Western Asia again by taking
        over the Gaza Strip? Why annex fucking Canada, a country that just fought guerillas for 20 years in Afghanistan
        and has absolutely no interest in being an American subject? Yeah that's what I want to get into in Canada,
        another counter-insurgency operation we're never going to win.
      </p>
      <p>
        All I can fathom is that these are Trump's self-interest, not the American government's self-interest. Trump
        spoke of rebuilding the Gaza Strip as a "real estate venture." He benefits from the Russo-Ukraine War ending on
        favorable terms to Putin because Trump just likes Putin. I'm frankly unsure why he wants to annex Canada so
        badly; I'm torn between "patriotic dick-waving" and "natural resource hoarding."
      </p>
      
      <h2>Conservative Cruelty</h2>
      <h3>Immigrants and Unjust Deportations</h3>
      <p>
        Trump has been characteristically racist towards Latin American migrants ever since his second inauguration.
        Basically the moment he got sworn in, ICE descended on major cities to sweep up anyone of Latin American descent
        that didn't immediately have their immigration papers on them. While the regime has touted the murderers and
        drug traffickers that they're rounded up, it serves to hush up the many undocumented immigrants swept up who
        were working harder than anyone appointed by the president has ever worked (yes I'm including every veteran and
        National Guard member, most of them don't do jack) and didn't commit crime beyond not having documentation or
        overstaying a green card. It's also swept the multiple American citizens they arrested under the rug because ICE
        cops are too fucking stupid to waste time figuring out if that brown person is a citizen or not.
      </p>
      <p>
        Despite decades of evidence from the FBI saying that immigrants, both documented and undocumented, are far
        less likely to commit crimes (especially violent crimes) than "native-born" Americans, Republicans <em>and</em>
        Democrats played hard into the "criminal aliens" hysteria. Both parties have been cracking down on immigration
        ever since Biden became president. Trump is taking the rhetoric and actions to whole new level though, trying to
        move "violent" immigrants to Guantanamo Bay, the site of some of America's worst crimes against humanity over
        the past 25 years. It won't just be violent criminals either, it will be whole families, including children who
        never knew of a life outside the United States.
      </p>

      <h3>More Transgender Hate</h3>
      <p>
        The past few weeks have been an absolute nightmare for every transgender person I know, including myself. I
        don't know why I keey being surprised by the amount of hate we get, but it's exhausting. I've written about this
        before <a href="../personal/reflections-on-2024.html">here</a> and <a href="./fog-of-weird.html">here</a>, but
        it bears repeating that this feels like the Twilight Zone. The obsessive focus American conservatives have
        placed on transgender people is infuriating and degrading, and they reason they try it is because it lets them
        normalize bigotry and violence towards minorities even more. Violence and discrimination towards unwanted
        minorities has always been bad in America, but this is getting even worse.
      </p>
      <p>
        On Friday, February 14, it was revealed that the National Park Service had stripped all references to trans and
        queer identities from the Stonewall Inn website. It's not LGBTQ+ anymore, it's just LGB. Marsha P Johnson is
        never mentioned to be transgender, when she threw the first damn brick. The LGB Alliance (a conservative
        astroturf group if I've ever seen one) finally got a win. The administration has been trying to throw all
        transgender people out of the military, and the Army responded by saying "we won't let soldiers take HRT for the
        purpose of transitioning, but we will let them take HRT for the purpose of treating gender dysphoria." They
        told Trump to go fuck himself, it's great.
      </p>
      <p>
        I'm heartened by some of the pushback Republicans have gotten on discriminating against transgender people. Here
        in Georgia, Senate Bill 1 (SB1) was the first thing introduced into the Senate, specifically banning males
        (defined "biologically" here as a way to attack transgender women) from participating in girls' / women's
        sports. They picked the sports issue because that's the easiest way to get concerned (braindead) parents on
        their side about making sure those rough, mean "boys" don't hurt their daughters.
      </p>
      <p>
        I wasn't really expecting much opposition from the Democratic senators in my state, but they actually mounted a
        fairly strong attack on this bill during the floor debate. While rich Republican senators, looking like they had
        just come into town from their plantations, accused Democrats of hating the concept of fairness for opposing the
        bill, Democrats came out strongly against it. They talked at length about the harms this would cause an
        especially vulnerable population, the failure of Republicans to find any reason to enact such a ban in Georgia
        (since there's almost no transgender athletes ere, especially in schools), and the deeper meaning behind the
        bill which is to eradicate transgender people from public life. The bill passed 35-17, with 2 Democrats voting
        in favor and 4 Democrats not being present. The senator I think did the best on the debate was Scott McLaurin
        from the 14th District. He's clearly intelligent and principled, and possibly out for revenge as he used to bunk
        with JD Vance at Yale Law School.
      </p>

      <h2>Advocacy: About Time I Got Off My Ass</h2>
      <p>
        I actually went down to the Capitol to watch this play out live. I expected I would hate being exposed to the
        kind of unceasing hatred that Republican lawmakers spewed. On one hand, it was absolutely vile, portraying
        transgender women as evil, godless people who only transitioned to prey on the children of G-d fearing (white)
        parents. On the other, it was really hard to look at them and not assume they were all brainless wannabe
        plantation owners. Republicans came across as hateful, pathetic, rich, and intensely untrustworthy.
      </p>
      <p>It was harder to look at them and not assume I could do better.</p>
      <p>
        Meanwhile, the Democrats came across as well-meaning if a bit confused. Incorrect terminology got used two or
        three times, but they were clearly fighting against it. I saw this most clearly in the amendments proposed to
        the bill by two Democratic senators, one of whom was Kim Jackson from the 42th district. The amendments would
        have addressed unfairness in girls' sports by ensuring both men's and women's teams were given equal priority in
        access to facilities, as men's teams almost always have priority to the women. Another would have addressed the
        pay gap between coaches for boys and coaches for girls. Both amendments failed because, as this dance of
        politics showed, Republicans do not give a single fuck about fairness and voted them both down.
      </p>
      <p>
        I sat back in 2024, consuming the news and generally feeling grim but hopeful. I didn't like the idea of
        canvassing or phone-banking, so I didn't really do anything political besides vote and make a bit of noise on
        social media. I can't sit back like that again. The stakes are way too high for that sort of behavior, and I'm
        angry with myself for just letting it happen. So instead of sitting in that anger, I'm redirecting it at the
        people who have chosen to make my life worse, to steal my rights and my dignity.
      </p>
      <p>
        While I may not be able to stop Elon Musk from plundering Treasury funds, I can and have called my senators to
        tell them to speak up about the damage this is causing. While I can't stop Republican senators in Georgia from
        continuing their campaign of extermination, I can ensure I'm around for the next generation of trans people. I
        may not be able to get big money out of the Democratic Party, but I can work to keep that party focused on
        opposing the Trump administration at every turn and ensure that there are people in power that give a damn about
        the working class, even if I may not like the DSA that much.
      </p>
      <p>
        I'm not interested in continuing with life as normal. Things have to change to get better. I have to be one
        person putting the work in.
