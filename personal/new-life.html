      <h2>I am not dead yet!</h2>
      <p>
        It's been a fairly busy couple of months for me, especially outside of work. I feel like I've done a lot, but
        not much I want to talk about doing. It's hard to tell when the concern for safety turns into paranoia and
        anxiety-fueling worry sessions. However, it's probably for the best I talk about something. Don't want you few
        readers to worry or anything.
      </p>
      <p>
        First, I want to lay out some stuff I plan to write on soon. Then I'll talk about something weighing on me for
        the past few weeks.
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>Antisemitism and anti-Zionism on the political Left</li>
        <li>Post-Mortem of the 2025 Georgia legislative session</li>
        <li>Political involvement over the past 3 months</li>
        <li>Warhammer 40K rambling (palette cleanser)</li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        I also plan to finally post some creative writing. I recently wrote about 2k words of WH40K fanfic that I want
        to share, and there's some Empty Spaces writing I'd like to put out there. I've since moved on from ES as
        anything but a bunch of ideas to write about instead of a way to categorize myself. I may get into that some day
        as well, but it's fairly spooky.
      </p>

      <h2>Estrogen and New Life</h2>
      <p>
        You know how people who convert to a religion like Christianity say they feel renewed and alive again? Filled
        with the presence and love of God and ready to share it with the world? The zeal of the convert is very real,
        and for me that was estrogen. Doing it specifically by injection has been incredibly empowering because it feels
        more real to me than just taking a pill or putting on a patch. It's visceral, it's sometimes painful, it's
        uncomfortable, and it's <em>mine</em>.
      </p>
      <p>
        I spoke <a href="./month-of-action.html">previously</a> about just what it did to me, but I'm still utterly
        stunned by just how strong it was. I never would have gone down to the Gold Dome before my E shot. Heck, I was
        just expecting my time working on anti-trans legislation would be writing up reports for the real experts to go
        in there and use. But instead, I testified, and despite how terrified I was, I felt stronger than I ever have
        doing that, and I'm including the (to me) impressive feats I pulled off on the bouldering wall.
      </p>
      <p>
        Looking back on what I was like before, I'm at a loss for how I was able to breathe before taking E. It seems
        like I convinced myself I didn't need air or water or food out of fear of what would happen to me. But hot damn,
        being able to breathe and move is <em>so liberating!</em> Yeah, I'm still worried about what people will think
        when I go out but I just have to tell myself that a) my anxiety is a loud, evil bitch, and b) I'm happier for
        being alive and living my truth (god I hate that phrase) than staying in the closet. The closet will kill you in
        its own way. Instead of being beaten by cops or run over by some loser in a lifted Escalade, it's a slow
        degrading suicide. Instead of chipping away a space for yourself in the world, you're chipping away at yourself
        for the world and its bullshit to fester in. It will never be satisfied with colonizing just one piece of your
        soul&mdash;it is a insatiable, devouring beast that will consume your entirety until you ditch your self or your
        life. It is no way to live.
      </p>
      <p>
        I understand being scared of that, of deciding it's just easier to carve out pieces of yourself so you're more
        presentable, more hireable, more worthy of dignity. I told myself that for 6 years after coming out to myself
        that I didn't need hormones, that I didn't need to dress feminine, that I was a woman despite not looking like
        one. And that was true, but it was deceitful in its own way. It convinced me I <em>never</em> needed hormones,
        didn't even deserve hormones, and that I could just live with worsening dysphoria if some of my friends used my
        name and pronouns while I was around them. I'm still going to stealth as masc when I go in for interviews
        because I don't have anything legally changed, and that's my damn fault. I <em>wish</em> I could go to an
        interview in a blouse and blazer instead of a dress shirt and tie. That would make me immensely happy.
      </p>
      <p>
        That day will come, because I'm actually moving to make it happen. It isn't easy, but it's the only real option.
        If you're trans, you get one big decision: you learn to swim, or you drown. You may just learn to tread water,
        barely keeping your head above water, whether because of circumstance or because every other "inclusive" LGBT
        person in your life is trying to drown you. It's miserable in its own way.
      </p>
      <p>
        I'm reminded of
        <a href="https://medium.com/@jencoates/i-am-a-transwoman-i-am-in-the-closet-i-am-not-coming-out-4c2dd1907e42">
          this piece
        </a>
        by Jen Coates, about how during the 2010s, the young feminist movement was intensely opposed to masculine people
        despite all the harm it would end up doing. The constant judgement and misandry from cis women feminists who
        interpreted their feminism as "Man bad" instead of anything that a ounce of effort could have produced pushed
        Jen back in the closet and who knows how many others. The social murder machine is still going strong on BlueSky
        despite the fact we really should fucking know better at this point. We as trans people should be able to expect
        our main opponent in the fight for our dignity is Christian nationalists, TERFs, and bioessentialist doctors,
        not people who claim to be allies before refusing to consider us equals.
      </p>
      <p>
        Despite that, and the crushing, strangling grip of dysphoria telling you it will never be enough and that you'll
        never pass, forging on has done wonders for my mental health. I have bad days, bad nights, but not nearly as
        often as before I was taking estrogen. I feel so much stronger from where I used to be. I've done things I never
        would have considered doing just a year ago. A friend has told me it's like the shot activated a sleeper agent.
        I'm intensely grateful for that.
      </p>
      <p>
        There's a whole life waiting out there for you. Seize it. Wrestle it. Make it yours. Every contradiction, every
        strange branch and difference. Walk them all. It's yours. It demands you own it. Life is nothing but
        contradictions and impossibilities. Embrace them. Defy them.
