      <h1>A Month of Action</h1>
      <time datetime="2025/03/18">March 18, 2025</time>

      <h2>The Current Times</h2>
      <p>
        I don't need to go on about the current state of the world much. You've been keeping up with the news. (If
        you're from the future, (a) I'm so sorry, and (b) please tell me they haven't banned Mexican food.) It is an
        unmitigated shitshow at the moment. People are protesting near daily, with the 50501 movement doing some
        incredible legwork. Trans people are sharing resources on how to move to Canada or get Canadian citizenship.
        This is not normal, and I refuse to accept it as the new normal.
      </p>
      <p>
        You would expect these circumstances to make people curl up into a ball and die from overexposure. That's what I
        felt like I was doing the first full month of the administration and the 2 months leading up to it. It's pretty
        overwhelming. What with attacks on immigration, trans rights, and free speech, it was tempting to just keep
        hiding and waiting.
      </p>
      <p>
        But I didn't do that. The first month of the administration was one of fear and dread. The second month of this
        administration has been dread and an overpowering desire to win. There's a fire in my chest and a curse upon my
        lips. I chalk that up to three things: (1) being around people that are actually doing the work; (2) a
        burgeoning religious zealotry, and (3) HRT.
      </p>

      <h2>My Birthright</h2>
      <p>
        Estrogen changed me in ways I wasn't expecting. While I'm only a month into it currently, the very act of taking
        my own future into my hands like that set off a fire I didn't know I had been laying kindling for. Or maybe
        someone else was laying that for me and I just didn't notice until now. Either way, that fire is absolutely lit,
        and despite how grim everything looks it won't stop burning.
      </p>
      <p>
        I'm doing this DIY, so no doctor's visits or referrals or waiting for a diagnosis just for prescribing
        transgender HRT to be criminalized in my state. There are a couple informed consent clinics within an hour's
        drive of me, but I didn't choose those largely out of insurance being weird and wondering if it will even cover
        that. Instead of patches or pills, I went straight for injections. I think that method of getting my estrogen is
        what's really supercharged this, because it feels so real, and if I can stick myself with a needle once a week I
        can absolutely do everything else I've been doing.
      </p>
      <p>
        I absolutely would not have started on HRT without one specific person damn near bullying me into making my
        healthcare a priority. <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/laurelai.inanna.app">Laurelai Bailey</a> is a friend of
        mine who absolutely refused to let go of me getting hormones. She pointed me to the distributor, pointed me to
        the injection supplies, and gave me a rundown on which needles to use for what. She's a lifesaver, frankly.
        She's also part of the religious purpose I find so strongly at this moment.
      </p>

      <h2>Religion and Resistance</h2>
      <p>Going to a Jewish Reform temple for 11 months apparently affects your religious views. Who knew?</p>
      <p>
        I've been going to temple since March last year, specifically around Pesach. Since going there, I've moderated
        my stance some on the Israel-Palestine conflict (not something I'm getting into now), been more conscious about
        whether the food I'm eating is kosher (while still chowing down on bacon now and again), and been internalizing
        a lot of the resistance and longevity of the traditions and stories. Speaking of stories, it is Purim (as of the
        time I'm writing this), yet another holiday to celebrate a failed massacre!
      </p>
      <p>
        So many of the holidays and stories in Judaism remind me of just how important resistance, struggle, and
        community are. Esther was not just fighting for herself or for Mordechai, she was fighting for every Jew in
        Persia. Hanukkah celebrates a more militant response to the crisis, although all of the violence depicted in the
        Books of the Maccabees is directed at Jews that weren't religiously observant enough. Every Shabbat is about
        coming together and taking a rest from the stress of the previous week. It feels <em>right</em>.
      </p>
      <p>
        I'm also grateful for the two rabbis I've gotten to know during my time at this temple. The first one I met
        there used to be a Conservative rabbi who's frankly the coolest rabbi I've ever met. He incorporated stuff from
        Eastern Asian traditions (without it being the weird New Age way that I dislike), he's very down to earth, and
        is trained in both armed and unarmed self defense. After he left, the temple went without a rabbi for a few
        months before settling on a Reconstructionist rabbi who was on sabbatical. He's splitting his time between the
        Reform temple and a Conservative congregation. He's less cool than the first rabbi, but he's been very affirming
        and I've loved how he approaches the Torah and the readings and teachings. Both of them have been very
        influential in my wanting to keep coming back and have been great about answering my questions. I'm grateful to
        have met them both.
      </p>
      <p>
        I also deeply appreciate the effort Laurelai has made building a church to Inanna on Discord. Inanna is a
        Sumerian goddess of love, power, and sex, and has been adopted as a matron of transgender people for millennia
        because Her priestesses in Sumer were transgender and gender non-conforming. While I don't see myself switching
        to that religion, I'm certainly in favor of the project. She's been doing wonderful work.
      </p>

      <h2>If I Had a Hammer</h2>
      <p>
        While I've been watching politics for a long, <em>long</em> time, I haven't really gotten that involved. Sure, I
        have a political science degree and I kept up with international politics, I wasn't able to affect any sort of
        change. Bit hard to change the policy of the United States Department of State to bring the hammer down on
        Netanyahu's criminal war as someone not even working inside the State Department. Especially now that Trump is
        president.
      </p>
      <p>
        Refocusing that attention and effort towards local work was clearly the better move, and I got a golden
        opportunity during a support group meeting. Someone came in asking if anyone was interested in getting involved
        with the state legislature, and I felt like the luckiest person in the room at the moment. Also the craziest,
        because no one else was <em>nearly</em> as enthusiastic about it. From there, I got roped into going through
        legislation targeting the transgender population and summarizing their effects. My energy and involvement grew
        quickly, as this is clearly something I'm good at. I <em>really</em> should have gotten that paralegal
        certificate from my school.
      </p>
      <p>
        In less than a month, I went from a scared but angry trans girl watching things generally get worse to an
        angrier woman actually doing something. In less than 24 hours, I went from doing my first estrogen shot, a
        nerve-wracking experience that took nearly an hour to set up and get through, to
        <a href="../politics/hb267-hearing.html">testifying in front of a subcommittee</a> to argue for my basic right
        to dignity. That shot did something to me. While I only filled the syringe up with 0.18mL of estradiol, there
        was clearly something else in there: a soul I'd beaten and neglected for years.
      </p>
      <p>
        I haven't stopped at that hearing either. I've been down to the Capitol twice since, once to rally for trans
        rights as an anti-DEI bill was passed in our senate, and once to see the Crossover Day deadline and watch for
        any shenanigans. I regularly attend county Democratic Party meetings, both to see what's going on with the
        elections this year and in 2026, and unintentionally to represent both myself and the broader trans population.
        Bit harder for people to ignore us when I'm there as a reminder. (Not like the Democrats that do attend are
        ignoring us, it's more those who never interact with the party.)
      </p>
      <p>
        Thinking on that further, I never really considered being there specifically as a representative of the trans
        population here. I was coming for myself first but I may have to be there as a constant reminder of what the
        fight is for. I've seen lots of gender non-conforming and transgender-umbrella folks at the Democratic
        Socialists of America meetings, but basically just me at the Democratic meetings. Honestly, the thing I need
        most from folks is to stop apologizing for calling me "bro" before explaining they mean it in a gender neutral
        way. Like, I'm not crying over it, I'm more annoyed that they're falling back on it. I just want them to take
        the brief social stumble in stride and not make a whole thing out of it. Being there is a stark reminder both
        that I am a minority and that there are politicians that support my rights.
      </p>
      <p>
        Speaking of rights, HB267 has another hearing tomorrow, this time in front of a Senate Judiciary subcommittee.
        I'm going to be there, mark my words.
