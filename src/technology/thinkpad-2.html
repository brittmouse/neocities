        <h1>ThinkPad T480, Pt. 2</h1>
        <time datetime="2024/10/05"><i>October 5, 2024</i></time>
        <p>So, here we are again.</p>

        <h2>Receiving the ThinkPad</h2>
        <p>After the mixup from <a href="./thinkpad-1.html">last time</a>, I received a better ThinkPad T480 on <time
          datetime="202409/27">September 27</time>. This time, I got a T480 with an Intel Core i7-8650U (slightly better
          than what I was originally planning on), 16 GB of DDR4 RAM running at 2400 MHz, and a 512 GB SSD.</p>
        <p>The first thing I did after getting it was look inside to check the condition and get my used to how it
          looked. I was blown away by how easy it was to disassemble. Removing the external battery was a piece of cake.
          Six captive screws that I could loosen with a simple #0 sized Philips-head screwdriver is already a massive
          improvement over the IdeaPad, with its ten non-captive screws, one of which I've since lost. After that, it
          was just a matter of undoing the plastic clamps around the edge of the bottom cover (something I did with my
          fingernails but which should be done with a specific tool) and presto, the cover was off and I could check
          just what was inside.</p>
        <p>Inside there was a single stick of DDR4-2400 from Samsung, a 512 GB solid state drive in the 2.5 inch drive
          bay, and the internal battery. Both the internal and external battery were rated for 24 Wh, but the internal
          battery is only at 66% capacity due to degradation. With that configuration, it gets me about the same amount
          of battery life that the IdeaPad does with its single 48 Wh battery. There was some dust on the fan but I've
          removed it.</p>
        <p>Since there's only one stick of RAM in at the moment, I could easily upgrade this machine to 32 GB with a
          single install. This may be something for the future since right now 16 GB is a comfortable amount. I may also
          install a second SSD in the free NVMe slot, but I want to do more research on whether that would even work.
        </p>
        <p>While the first one I bought mistakenly was $170, this turned out to be $270, which for not having to do any
          repairs or replacements so far is really good.</p>

        <h2>My Time With It</h2>
        <p>While I had some ideas for this originally, like putting Debian Testing or EndeavourOS on it, I didn't end up
          doing any of what I had originally had planned (at least so far). I didn't have a EndeavourOS .iso laying
          around on either my desktop or laptop, and I didn't really want to put in the effort of grabbing the torrent
          file and waiting for that to finish for either of them. Instead, I had a flash drive with the most recent
          release of Arch Linux on it (specifically 2024.09.01). I used that to install Arch onto my new ThinkPad.</p>
        <p>My install wasn't that easy, but that was on me forgetting something very important. The ThinkPad came
          installed with Windows 11 on it stock, so I booted into BIOS and set my flash drive as the primary boot drive.
          For whatever reason, this refused to work each of the 10-ish times I restarted the laptop to get it to work.
          It was a solid hour before I realised "Oh wait, I have to disable Secure Boot." It took me a couple of minutes
          to find that, but once I found and disabled Secure Boot it booted right into the Arch live environment.</p>
        <p>I was originally intending to go through a manual install of Arch, so I followed the wiki for the first
          little bit. I connected to my home Wi-Fi, set my keyboard layout and locale, and the promptly gave up on the
          manual install and used the <code>archinstall</code> script. I have installed Arch the hard way before on my
          desktop, following <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YC7NMbl4goo&pp=ygUSaG93IGkgaW5zdGFsbCBhcmNo">Dream
            Of Code's video</a> on it and installed GNOME. However, I hated GNOME and redid that manual install with KDE
          Plasma and somehow screwed it up. I didn't want to have that same headache with my ThinkPad so I took the easy
          way out. Sue me.</p>
        <p>I took the boring path and installed the KDE Plasma 6 desktop. I have used the desktop before for short
          periods of time and didn't like it as much as I liked the Cinnamon desktop. This time though I really wanted
          to give it a shot, and I'm so glad I did. It's the basic bitch of Linux hipsters but I'm running Arch with KDE
          Plasma on a ThinkPad. It's a whole stereotype and I am it.</p>
        <p>I'm glad too because the ThinkPad fucking rocks! The keyboard was a changeup from what I was used to on the
          IdeaPad but it's a clear improvement. I love not having my hands off-center from the display because of some
          numpad. I love the smaller form factor (even if it is heavier and thicker). I love how good the display is
          after over a year with what's probably the worst display I've seen on a modern laptop. Seriously, IdeaPad
          screens are garbage! Again, I just love the keyboard, it's super thumpy and it sounds and feels great to type
          on. It's a bit of a change-up because the Ctrl and Fn keys on the bottom left have swapped but it does feel
          pretty comfortable after this long with it, even if it does mean swapping between the ThinkPad keyboard and a
          mechanical keyboard leaves me feeling a bit confused. I like having a touchscreen even if I don't use it that
          much. And the trackpad, oh my GOD the trackpad. I've been spoiled so quickly on the trackpad and buttons. It's
          such a massive benefit that I don't know if I'll be able to be comfortable using a different laptop ever again,
          that is how good it is.</p>
        <p>Now it isn't perfect by any means. The battery life being about the same as the IdeaPad does kinda suck, even
          if I don't normally have to worry about it. The speakers are awful. Even with a 4-core CPU, the computer does
          struggle to keep up with me typing in Discord, largely due to just how heavy that application is on the CPU
          and not due to the CPU itself. I know for a fact it won't run new games (and I don't have any intention of
          turning this into a gaming device anyways, aside from Space Cadet Pinball, puzzles, and board games). However,
          for writing, web browsing, and general tasks and light scripting, it's fantastic.</p>
        <p>I'm also really enjoying using Arch Linux on it. </p>

        <h2>Future Plans</h2>
        <p>Right now I plan on using this as my daily driver for the foreseeable future, meaning I have an IdeaPad just
          sitting around not doing anything. That may get repurposed as a remote storage computer, but it's also a
          little bit too power-consumptive to do basic homelab stuff efficiently. I'll likely still use it as I have so
          much stuff on there, but I'm not likely to actively choose it often. As of the time of writing, it needs to be
          upgraded to Mint 22 alongside the desktop so that's going to happen soon if not immediately after publishing
          this.</p>
        <p>As for upgrades, I don't have a need to put more RAM or storage into this as of right now. The upgrades I see
          myself most likely to take include upgrade both the internal and external batteries with higher capacity
          versions and potentially something weird like installed the 1440p display since what I have now is 1080p or
          putting in the cool T430 keyboard. If I ever get a Framework 13, this will likely become a server interface so
          I can interact with a NAS, SBC running PiHole, Git remote, or Nextcloud instance. Having the ThinkPad be the
          main interface for a self-hosted home technology solution would be very cool.</p>
