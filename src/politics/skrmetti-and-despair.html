      <h1>Skrmetti: A Case Against Despair</h1>
      <time datetime="2025/06/19">June 19, 2025</time>

      <h2>The Vibes are Bad</h2>
      <p>
        I'm not the only one feeling at least a little upset at the Supreme Court's decision on
        <cite>U.S. v Skrmetti</cite> <sup><a href="#1">1</a></sup> , that being to side with the state of Tennessee on
        banning gender-affirming care to minors. It's a pretty significant blow to the broader fight for trans rights,
        but it isn't the end of the world. Immediately after the hearing, Georgia Equality executive director Jeff
        Graham said that because the opinion was narrowly focused, it doesn't apply to things like trans participation
        in sports, non-discrimination in school and employment, and healthcare access for adults. He also said that
        Georgia Equality is going to be fighting any anti-trans acts in the Georgia General Assembly and the courts, so
        I am not worried about losing the support of the pro-queer groups in Georgia. Or nationally for that matter.
      </p>
      <p>
        I don't want to talk about the specifics of <cite>Skrmetti</cite>, as people more qualified than I have talked
        about it already, albeit with more despair than I would. What I want to talk about instead is the increased
        legislative risk going into 2026 and resisting that despair and aimless anger to instead turn it towards getting
        your hands in the dirt.
      </p>

      <h2>Legislatures Set Everything on Fire</h2>
      <p>
        Before I got involved with local politics and started paying very close attention to what Georgia's state
        politicians do (which to the untrained eye looks like constantly being spun around a carnival ride until ill), I
        was watching the world seemingly go to hell in a hand basket over social media. Part of that was because most
        things are just getting worse, part of it was the absolutely horrid grip my Rot and its depression had over me,
        and part of it was that I felt like the most I could do was keep up to date and chat with friends about it
        instead of hit the bricks.
      </p>
      <p>
        Thankfully for myself and the people around me, I did end up
        <a href="../personal/month-of-action.html">wrestling it off of me</a>
        and standing up for our rights. It was absolutely the best thing I could have done and I will never stop
        bringing it up. Getting in touch with local activists, seeing exactly what bills are coming down the pipeline,
        and, importantly, trying to stop it in my own tiny ways, feels way better than just doomscrolling through the
        same news that comes out after they pass (or even lack of news, since the only thing Erin Reed reported on here
        in GA was the SB185 House vote walkout).<sup><a href="#2">2</a></sup> Moreover, this helps me know just what we
        need to be scared of going into 2026 here in Georgia.
      </p>

      <h3>Fires going strong</h3>
      <p>
        First, 3 anti-trans bills passed the Georgia General Assembly (GGA) in 2025: SB1, a trans sports ban; SB36, the
        Religious Freedom Restoration Act, and; SB185, a ban on state inmates from receiving gender-affirming care. All
        of these were upsetting to lose, but considering the makeup of the GGA, there's only so much pro-trans activists
        and politicians could do to stop or slow these bills.
      </p>
      <p>
        The losses here are tragic but comparatively small: at most there are 5 transgender inmates in state custody
        that have been impacted by this. Considering federal bans on gender-affirming care for federal inmates are being
        successfully challenged in court as a violation of the protection against cruel and unusual punishment
        <cite> (Kingdom v. Trump) </cite>, I have hope about this being overturned in the courts.
      </p>
      <p>
        Sports bans and RFRA have their own problems, particularly alienating transgender students from their classmates
        and green-lighting discrimination against transgender Georgians based on religious opposition to our existence;
        the latter is even worse because this state does not have a civil rights law like there is on the federal level.
        Unsurprising for a Jim Crow state.
      </p>

      <h3>Fires quelled</h3>
      <p>
        Second, there are anti-trans bills that outright failed this session. SB57, the "Freedom of Speech and Belief
        Act" introduced by Blake Tillery, played into conspiracy theories about ESG investing, social credit scores, and
        discrimination against conservatives in every aspect in society. It's the chief example of "carnival ride
        politics" in my opinion, as hearing Tillery blather on about seven different conspiracy theories for over 40
        minutes <em>on Crossover Day</em> shows just how batshit state legislatures on.
      </p>
      <p>
        HB267 is the sports ban I've written about several times (<a href="./hb267-analysis.html">here</a>,
        <a href="./hb267-hearing.html">here</a>, and <a href="./anti-trans-2.html">here</a>), and it died in the Senate
        Judiciary Committee after having every part of the bill that would have defined transgender and intersex people
        out of existence cut out, in part due to our opposition, and in (in my opinion larger) part due to likely
        internal GA GOP politicking.
      </p>

      <h3>Fires laying dormant and yet to light</h3>
      <p>
        Third, there are bills that didn't finish this session but did get some progress that should be looked at very
        closely. SB30 would have banned all gender-affirming care for minors, getting rid of the grandfather clause in
        the current ban. SB39 would have banned the state employee health insurance program from covering any trans
        healthcare. Both passed the Senate, got into the House with some amendments (meaning if it passed the Senate
        would have to vote again to okay the new amendments), but the Senate adjourned sine die before the House even
        held their vote, putting an end to both of those bills for the session.
      </p>
      <p>
        SB248 is a clean libraries / "don't say gay" / forced outing bill that didn't pass the Senate. The main concern
        among the people I was working with was the language being inserted into another bill (creating a "zombie
        bill"), like what happened with SB127, an anti-DEI bill. That language was inserted into HB120, a bill
        originally about increasing teacher sick days from 3 to 5, and as a result Senate Democrats filed 20 amendments
        during the floor debate that included such bangers as "Academic freedom in the state of Georgia is under threat.
        Please help," from State Sen. Nabliah Islam Parkes (D-SD-7).<sup><a href="#3">3</a></sup>
      </p>
      <p>
        These threats are what I'm concerned about going into 2026, and what I'm going to be spending a lot of my
        efforts trying to oppose. I also suspect (know, really) that Georgia Republicans are going to be introducing
        even worse stuff going forward. They are emboldened and so far the greatest obstacle they face is their own
        internal politicking as opposing factions battle for who's going to be the next governor, lieutenant governor,
        and attorney general. Sadly, there hasn't been much reporting on that legislation specifically. Much of what I
        had to work with was leaked by staffers or that I got from groups I was organizing with. It's very insider
        information. It needs to be publicized, but it's hard to get that from the current state of social media.
      </p>

      <h2>Defiance, the Anti-Despair</h2>
      <p>
        I currently believe the popular circles of BlueSky are engaging in an unhealthy level of despairing and taking
        their anger out on targets like Sarah McBride and the Democrats at large. I get where this is coming from, as
        I'm also annoyed at Rep. McBride for saying trans people pushed too quickly for our own rights, and the New York
        Times is despicably lionizing anti-trans talking points. However, I just can't bring myself to spend much energy
        thinking about it. Like, alright it sucks, <em>what are our next steps?</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        First, the national Democratic party is not giving up on trans rights. There are individuals within the party
        that are trying to get that outcome because "we're a political liability," and anecdotally there's a push among
        the rank-and-file to stop falling into these supposed legislative traps (heh) and focus on economic
        progressivism, but the Democratic lawmakers I've spoken to are even madder than we are at the GOP for
        hyperfocusing on trans people. In Georgia, lawmakers like Sen. Kim Jackson, Dr. Rep. Jasmine Clark, and Rep.
        Ruwa Romman have all described these attacks as "bullying" and harmful. Sen. Josh McLaurin not only exposed the
        entire exterminationist campaign during floor debate on SB1 but tied it into the longer history of anti-civil
        liberties conservatism (during an Indivisible people's town hall on May 29).
      </p>
      <p>
        Second, the progress made on transgender rights by both activists and politicians over the past decade cannot be
        overstated. We have been too normalized within society to go back to the 2000s, or even the 1970s. Despite the
        fears of today and the months and years to come, we are going to win this in the end. It's a matter of getting
        as many of us to that victory and getting it as soon as possible.
      </p>
      <p>
        Just how we do that is, as ever, a massive argument colored by personal bias and political ideology. Personally,
        while I prefer anarchist theory and organizing, I feel what's needed is both loudly opposing anti-trans policy
        in state legislatures and directly helping transgender Americans through support groups, aiding flight from red
        states, and not committing social murder to soothe the brainworms. This is, frankly, a boring liberal approach
        to it, and hardly revolutionary, but I'm not really interested in a revolution that makes me sacrifice my
        medicine just to not get any of what I fought for at the end of it even if we win.
      </p>
      <p>
        Fighting this legislatively feels very natural for me and has been great for my mental well-being, even without
        really contributing to any wins. Just showing up and speaking to legislators, even the really transphobic ones
        who will never listen, is a defiant reminder that we aren't just going to roll over and die. In states such as
        Iowa, massive demonstrations have made that fact utterly unavoidable, while in Montana, transgender and
        nonbinary representation within the legislature have killed bills on the floor.
      </p>
      <p>
        It's why I don't really have the patience for the proclamations of doom on BlueSky. I get it, I want McBride to
        at least defend us in the news, and the tactic House Democrats are using is intensely frustrating as an
        outsider. But she's been working hard to ensure the entire Democratic conference is going to defend transgender,
        nonbinary, and intersex Americans in Congress. It's quiet, slow, frustrating work, but it does get results.
      </p>
      <p>
        I have seen the effects here in Georgia: only 54 Democrats voted against HB267 in February, but 64 voted against
        SB1 in March. Some religiously conservative Black lawmakers, like Okoye, Adeyina, and Bennett, were convinced to
        vote against it. The minority whip, Sam Park, was also present for SB1 which may have helped with getting the
        "No" votes. 75 out of 80 GA House Democrats walked out on SB185. Clearly there was work going on behind closed
        doors that got those things done.
      </p>
      <p>
        Stuff outside the legislature is just as key to determining our survival. From support groups like PFLAG to
        Pride events to protests, there are things we can do. Rotting in despair is not how we win. Getting our hands in
        the mud is how we win. Every day you live is a small victory. Every call you make or hearing you show up to is a
        victory. Cherish every single one of them. Remember not just to rest but to act. Get the hell off social media
        and affect some change.
      </p>
      <p>
        I don't care if I never see our liberation. I just need to know it will come. I'm not here to finish the bridge,
        just add my bricks to it.
      </p>
