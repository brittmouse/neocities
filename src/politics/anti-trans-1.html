      <h1>Fighting for My Sanity: Anti-Trans Rhetoric in 2024</h1>
      <time datetime="2024/10/20">October 20, 2024</time>

      <h2>Election Update</h2>
      <p>So, we are a little over 2 weeks out right now from the 2024 election, and I'm really ready for this to be
        over. I went to vote on the first day of polls being opened, which apparently was a <a
          href="https://www.wabe.org/georgia-voters-break-ballot-record-for-first-day-of-early-voting/">real record
          breaker</a> for ballots cast on the first day! That does give me some hope, as it shows citizens are getting
        engaged and paying a lot more attention to politics this year. Republican officials were quick to point out that
        this puts a hole in the argument that Georgia's election laws are "Jim Crow 2.0," as progressives have said that
        these laws (especially voter I.D. and voter roll purges) unfairly targeted African American citizens.
        Personally, I'm going to wait until I get more info on the stats of who voted as well as the larger voting
        patterns in the state as early voting continues and the final results.</p>
      <p>Despite this good news at the health of Georgia's voter base, it hasn't all been great news. The
        Trump-dominated State Election Board has made several new rules that severely fuck up the electoral process,
        like mandating a hand-count of all ballots in a county to be completed by three poll workers the night of the
        election (this would lead to a lot of errors just due to a natural human deficiency in counting) and allowing
        a county election official to object to the certification of votes in their precinct based on a "reasonable
        inquiry" without defining reasonable.</p>
      <p>One of those S.E.B. officials said later "we didn't think we had to define what 'reasonable' means," which is
        the "I didn't study" answer you could have <em>possibly</em> given. Every political science professor in twenty
        miles just sighed.</p>
      <p>A judge did strike down these rules down because a) they were published too close to the election, and b) for
        being illegal, specifically the "refuse to certify" rule as that conflicted with a law that says precinct
        officials "shall" certify the election results by the Monday evening after the election (or the Tuesday evening
        after if the Monday is a holiday like Veteran's Day). That "shall" leaves no room for an election denier's
        personal judgement that the majority black county's election is actually unfairly Democratic-leaning and to
        cancel the results.</p>

      <h2>Violent Rhetoric</h2>
      <p>Listen to any Trump speech the past few weeks (and it is Trump speaking, I'm half-convinced Vance is just
        dead), and he's been a mix of slurred words, nonsense rambles, and intense fear mongering. Between calling
        immigrants a "poison" to America's bloodstream, wanting to use the military to deport over 10 million
        undocumented migrants (claiming the number is as high as <em>25 million</em> to rile up his base even more), and
        declaring he would revoke ABC's broadcast license for daring to fact-check him in a debate where Trump agreed to
        let moderators fact-check.</p>
      <p>The willingness to lie and invoke increasingly violent imagery suggests two possibilities.</p>
      <ol>
        <li>He has completely lost it and it spewing random hateful rhetoric because his brain has rotted.</li>
        <li>He's still self-aware and is engaging in this rhetoric hoping that overly scared crowds will look to him as
          a savior and get him the votes he needs to become the 47th president (or possibly support extrajudicial
          violence against liberal voters and engage in more election fuckery).</li>
      </ol>
      <p>As much as I want to blame this on his brain turning into soup, this feels entirely too calculated to be the
        nonsense throes of a madman's last years. Granted, he does have "soup brain" moments fairly frequently, but the
        idea that he's using this sort of language because he lost it doesn't seem to fit with reality.</p>

      <h3>The Fucking Trans Ads</h3>
      <p>And this is where I talk about the spat of awful anti-trans ads that the Trump campaign has been running the
        past few weeks.</p>
      <p>If you've managed to avoid the ads while watching college football this year, first, I am deeply jealous;
        second, the ads hinge largely on "Kamala Harris using taxpayer dollars to do sexual reassignment surgeries on
        illegal MS-13 drug traffickers." No I'm not kidding. During the ad, Harris is depicted going easy on traffickers
        and rapists, and then talking with a drag queen about transition care for prisoners, before ending with "Kamala
        is for they/them; Donald Trump is for YOU."</p>
      <p>If this were a more coherent ad, I would be less mad about it. Previous ads (including these) said Harris had
        gone too easy on immigrants and gang members and that she had let too many go without putting them in prison.
        These ads now claim that she did put those people in jail but only to do sex changes on all of them using
        taxpayer money. It's the sort of incoherence of the broader messaging that seems to appeal to Trump voters,
        because the dumb ones who already vote for him don't really need a coherent argument, they just need to hate
        trannies harder.</p>
      <p>This stuff hurts because it relies on Americans being stupid about policy and the basic functions of
        government, which unfortunately is a safe bet. Hell, ask a Green Party or PSL voter why they're voting for Jill
        Stein or Claudia de la Cruz, and they will very quickly reveal that they don't know how the separation of powers
        work or the difference between state and federal policy over things like abortion and HRT access. Americans just
        don't pay attention to lackluster civics classes in high school, and I don't find it very likely that C-grade
        business administration students are going to pay attention in their mandatory American Government class.</p>
      <p>So, an explainer is in order.</p>
      <p>First, prisons using taxpayer money to fund the operation of the prison. That's how public prisons work. They
        are owned and operated by the government. If they weren't using government funds to operate, we'd have a much
        larger problem on our hands &ndash; exactly where they're getting tens of millions of dollars without public
        accountability.</p>
      <p>Second, prisoners need healthcare. A correctional institution must provide medical care to patients, no matter
        what they have (be it diabetes, malnourishment, depression, or even broken bones); otherwise, refusing to
        provide that medical care would fall under "cruel and unusual punishment" of inmates, which is prohibited under
        the Eighth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution.</p>
      <p>Third, gender-affirming care is medically necessary. Gender affirming healthcare for transgender people
        drastically lowers the chance of mental illness and suicidality. Despite attempts by conservatives to demonize
        and pathologize all trans people as sick, degenerate, and predatory, the facts remain that this healthcare,
        including hormone access, counseling, and gender-affirming surgeries, is life-saving and works.</p>
      <p>Fourth, these sorts of procedures have happened during the Trump administration, and it makes absolutely no
        sense to say Harris is a dirty Marxist (along with Obama, Bill Clinton, and probably Eisenhower at this rate)
        for getting healthcare to transgender inmates when it's not even new. Granted, Trump supporters aren't generally
        smart or in the know about anything but it still bugs me.</p>
      <p>Fifth, the argument just doesn't make much sense? Like, what does the Biden administration have to gain from
        performing sex changes on MS-13 operatives? I get the argument is that Democrats just hate White Americans and
        that only God-Emperor Trump will Protect the White Race, but it still comes across as pathetic and desperate.</p>
      <p>On a personal level the ads aggravate me, and that's because Republicans, being either ill-informed or lying,
        decided years ago to conflate trans women with drag queens, when these are not the same groups of people. There
        is overlap and a long historical interconnectedness but we are not the same. Like ideally the GOP would just
        stop hating trans people and drag queens, and there really isn't a point for them to differentiate between two
        different groups if it harms their messaging. Besides, I really doubt that a GOP voter is going to give a single
        fuck about the complexities of the topic when they can't even get around the idea of gay sex. Largely, this
        isn't even about the GOP ads specifically, but the broader social norm that conflates transgender women and drag
        queens to the point of each group being identical. This probably deserves a separate look but the conflation is
        intensely aggravating to me considering I really don't like drag and feel no small level of annoyance for being
        lumped in with them. This isn't a "pick me, I'm the good one" argument, as I'm under no pretense that society
        will <em>ever</em> accept transgender people, and I'm not willing to sacrifice drag queens to the menace that is
        Fox News just to save the skin of trans people who don't do drag. Again, I'll have to dissect it more later.</p>

      <h2>Democratic Pushback</h2>
      <p>The largely lackluster response of the Democratic campaign to, like, any of this is nearly as frustrating as
        listening to Vance try to interact with a normal fast-food worker. The DNC has so effectively flopped on the
        messaging that I'm surprised Harris let them have a single say. Staples like "we're not going back," "weird,"
        and "mind your damn business" have been gone for well over a month. Instead it's useless stump speech slops
        pushed by some politician's consultant friend hoping that this gets him a good multi-million dollar job lobbying
        for fucking Monsanto or something.</p>
      <p>A couple Democratic Senate candidates have fallen prey to GOP fearmongering about "boys in girl's sports", a
        claim backed up by such evidence as a woman who was on HRT for years winning a swimming competition, an Algerian
        boxer with a bit too much muscle to pass as a woman despite her suing multiple people for defamation (including
        Rowling), and a movie Stephen Crowder created and had to fake because it turns out the entire premise of the
        movie was so bullshit not a single amateur sports league would let him try it. The Senate candidates in Ohio and
        Texas both said they weren't in favor of trans people playing in a sports division of their chosen gender, not
        even mentioning if they would be alright with it after two to three years of HRT. Seeing that, along with
        Hillary Clinton in 2022 or 2023 saying giving up on trans rights might be politically expedient for the
        Democratic Party is intensely frustrating.</p>
      <p>However, there has been actual pushback from Harris and Walz on this. Harris did an interview on Fox News, and
        while the interviewer as about as rude and abrasive as you could be, as he was clearly looking for soundbytes
        and gotchas instead of policy, Harris actually did a good job shooting down the anti-trans rhetoric from Baier
        and the ads mentioned earlier. Walz pushed back even harder on a podcast appearance the next day. It was a much
        needed reassurance after several weeks of frustration from myself and other trans people. I'm not sure it will
        be enough, but anti-trans rhetoric has cost a lot of Republicans their elections in the past two years. I hope
        this one sticks as well.</p>
      <p>Now if the Democrats could stop being fucking worthless when talking about immigration in any capacity
        whatso-fucking-ever, that would be great.</p>
