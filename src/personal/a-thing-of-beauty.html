      <p>
        The remains of a star churned and wheeled around the young black hole, lit by a background of stars and vessels
        ferrying survivors from the destruction of their system. Its greedy maw was no threat to the fleet, happily
        gorging itself on the remains of Tolav, but Sister Naomi could not gaze upon it without malevolence settling
        into her bones.
      </p>
      <p>
        A shrine world. A holy system, birthplace of multiple saints and two of the most storied Sisters of Battle the
        Order of Our Blinded Lady had serving, was simply gone. It was not even due to something the Order could combat
        – no heretical Space Marines, no grand hosts come to scalp the Imperium, no Eldar plot. The star simply…gave up.
        There had been very little warning, only three standard weeks or so, and the assurances of more passenger liners
        being redirected to the system never resulted in ships. They had evacuated the relics, the libraries, and the
        Ecclesiarchy first. Every Sister of the Order was aboard.
      </p>
      <p>
        But there was not enough space for all the faithful. Tolav 1 had been too close to the star’s detonation and was
        glassed in mere hours. Tolav 2, Shrine-world of the Blinded Lady, survived, but it would never sustain life more
        advanced than microbes or odd creatures in the bowels of the oceans. Tolav 3 and 4 were no more than outposts
        with small mining operations, and were far enough away from Tolav proper to not really be affected, and would
        still likely supply the Imperium with some rarer minerals.
      </p>
      <p>It just was not enough. Nothing made up for this.</p>
      <p>
        Naomi scowled through the viewport, hoping beyond hope that her anger would make the black hole cease and return
        things to a prosperous, enlightened past.
      </p>
      <p>The black hole consumed with abandon, heedless of the thing of beauty its murder was creating.</p>
      <p>
        “Sister Naomi,” a woman hailed, and Naomi’s scowl lessened. It would be good to have the Sister Superior around.
        She turned and saw Ruth’vael behind her, wearing simple linen robes in the silver and red of the Order, hand
        clasped over her abdomen.
      </p>
      <p>
        Naomi bowed a few degrees and rose, her power armor clinking quietly. “Sister Superior, how may I assist you?”
      </p>
      <p>
        Ruth’vael smiled. “I’m here to check in with you. Several other sisters have required counsel, and I know there
        is not one among us who does not feel this deeply.”
      </p>
      <p>
        Naomi worked to twist the scowl off her face, pressing her lips together. Ruth already knew she was upset, best
        not take that out on her. “Indeed. This is,” she glanced out the viewport again, “not how I expected things to
        go. Invasions and heresy I can fight, but this is…beyond me.”
      </p>
      <p>
        Ruth nodded knowingly. “I cannot blame you. Many in the squad are struggling with this turn of events.” She
        crossed the short gap between them and placed a bare hand on Naomi’s right shoulderguard. “Making sense of this
        disaster may simply be beyond mere women.”
      </p>
      <p>
        “Have any—nevermind.” She winced, cursing herself for even considering this thought. But the words were out, and
        Ruth’s gaze hardened, the smile dropped for a neutral stare.
      </p>
      <p>“Do you ask if any of your sisters have strayed?”</p>
      <p>
        Naomi froze, staring through Ruth and into the void. Short doubts she could tolerate, accept even. The human
        mind was built for consider and work through every thought, and it wouldn’t surprise her if momentary doubts
        affected all but the most devout priests and Sisters. But those were brief human weakness and not the stuff of
        strife. She wondered, privately, if any of their faiths had truly been compromised.
      </p>
      <p>
        She chose her words carefully. “I do not believe we are immune to doubt. We can outwit it and strengthen the
        Emperor.” She spoke slowly, deliberately, and Ruth nodded. “I wondered if, with as dear a loss this is, whether
        mere doubts were…the least of your worries, Superior.”
      </p>
      <p>
        The smile returned to Ruth’s face, still warm but a hint less inviting. “I do not believe any Sister under my
        command will ever reject the truth. Especially not you,” she added, never removing her hand from Naomi’s armor,
        “for despite all your debating you’ve been as loyal and devout as any of your peers.”
      </p>
      <p>Naomi grinned and looked down, so that she saw less of her blushing face.</p>
      <p>
        “There is no hint of heresy among this squad. Merely an abiding need to act, whether to build or destroy. We
        have done exactly as the God-Emperor would have expected of any of his servants in such a time as this: protect
        His church, His warriors, and His faithful. The duty we are charged with is not simply one of conquest, of
        uprooting cults and expunging vile xenos from holy places. It is one of <em>protection</em>, of defending
        humanity from the worst of the galaxy, and that includes shepherding His flock to safe quarters.” With that,
        Ruth withdrew her hand from Naomi’s armor, and she felt a brief longing to be rid of this ceramite and let the
        recycled air flow around her.
      </p>
      <p>
        “Thank you, Sister Superior. I feel much more at ease now.” She let a contented smile spread and turned to look
        through the viewport again. The black hole had not sated its hunger and continued consuming the churning remains
        of Tolav, but this time it was not merely a death of a system. It was a work of art, and a thing of beauty.
      </p>
      <p>
        Naomi turned, ready to walk to her temporary quarters and change into her robes, but the sight of Ruth’vael’s
        face left her flatfooted. She scowled like a champion scorned of her triumph, venom flowing freely in her eyes.
        Had they been near an airlock, Naomi could believe her Superior would jump out, melta in hand, ready to purge
        like she had on Armageddon. “S-Superior?” she whispered.
      </p>
      <p>“Do you believe this was chance?”</p>
      <p>“I- beg your pardon?”</p>
      <p>
        “Do you believe Tolav’s death was chance, Sister Naomi?” Ruth’s gaze remained fixed on the viewport, one hand
        clenching and unclenching like a ritual prayer.
      </p>
      <p>
        “I…I can’t say.” Naomi’s mind reeled, dredging up astronomy classes from the schola that had been buried under
        years of warfare. “This did seem remarkably fast. Perhaps it was in decay long before and leadership thought it
        best to cover it up?”
      </p>
      <p>
        Ruth’s eyes flicked to Naomi and she immediately bit her tongue, cursing herself again for giving voice to that
        idea. “That may be possible,” Ruth said slowly, as if her silence were a dam. “Doing this anywhere in the
        Imperium would be cowardly and a denial of reality bordering on the traitorous. Especially so on a shrine
        world.” She was silent for several seconds.
      </p>
      <p>
        Naomi made no attempt to interrupt her train of thought. She remembered nothing on stars supposedly dying this
        quickly except through unnatural means, and after having given voice to her thoughts already, she didn’t want to
        worsen her Sister Superior’s state of mind.
      </p>
      <p>
        Evidently, Ruth’vael had as usual thought along the same lines as Naomi. “There are three options,” she
        considered, staring past the dying star instead of into it, “one is that the star truly did die this quickly due
        to some quirk of its construction, which the Mechanicus or Navy scientists would be able to figure out. Two is
        that it had been going on for years with no one in leadership making any plans or even acknowledging this
        publicly for fear of panic, which could be heretical. Three…
      </p>
      <p>“Three is that some party destroyed it.”</p>
      <p>
        ‘And we didn’t stop it,’ Naomi thought briefly, before a worse thought burst from her lips. “Who has the power
        to destroy a whole
        <em>star</em>?”
      </p>
      <p>
        Ruth’s posture shifted from dread-fueled stoicism to panicked contemplation, crossing one arm over her chest and
        using the other to cover her mouth with her hand. “Sister Naomi, you are quite adept at getting to the heart of
        anything. Unfortunately, I do not know enough to answer your question.” She stared at the black hole for a few
        moments before turning and walking briskly from the viewport, signaling Naomi to follow. “If your worries are
        true, then we’re currently blind to whatever comes next.”
      </p>
      <p>
        They moved together, muffled shuffles of robes masked by ceramite boots on the deck. Ruth made the sign of the
        aquila and murmured a familiar prayer under her breath, and Naomi followed her lead. “I did not mean to disturb
        you, I just—”
      </p>
      <p>
        “Anxiety can get the better of any of us, Sister. At this rate, it is not the duty of the Order to investigate
        Talov’s death. That matter falls to other hands.”
      </p>
      <p>
        As if on cue, a short man rounded the corner they were walking towards and looked towards them. He was dressed
        simply, with a short coat and low collar, work pants, and combat boots. On his belt, Naomi saw a slim dagger, a
        bolt pistol, and a rear pouch. His long hair was tied back in a ponytail, and dangling from his neck was a
        pendant with a holy symbol.
      </p>
      <p>“Excuse me,” he began, voice lacking any semblance of aristocracy, “are you Sister Superior Ruth’vael?”</p>
      <p>The Sisters stopped. “I am,” Ruth said, eyeing the newcomer. “Who are you?”</p>
      <p>
        “I am Interrogator Chaleron in the service of Inquisitor Maximus Thulani, Ordo Malleus. I was sent by him to
        find you; he wishes to speak with you.”
      </p>
      <p>
        Naomi blinked in surprise. The Ordo Malleus was well outside the spheres the Sisters operated within. During her
        time in the Order her squad had twice served as temporary members of Inquisitorial retinues, and both were
        organized by Ordo Hereticus inquisitors. An Ordo Malleus agent being present was disorienting. What could have
        drawn the Imperium’s fiercest daemon killers to Tolav? How worried did the servants of His Majesty’s Inquisition
        have to be to arrive here while Ordo Hereticus members were already present? Why was her squad being sought out?
      </p>
      <p>Ruth merely nodded, showing no trace of surprise. “Of course. Where shall I find him?”</p>
      <p>
        “The Inquisitor is currently preparing a meeting in conference room D-414 with several of His Majesty’s
        servants, including members of the Ordo Hereticus that have aided in the evacuation of the system.” He rummaged
        through his pockets until he found a data chit and handed it to Ruth. “He wishes to ask you about any hypotheses
        you may have about the death of Tolav.”
      </p>
      <p>
        “Truly?” she said, slipping the chit into her robes and glancing at Naomi, apparently as surprised as her
        subordinate but knowing better than to push. “When does Inquisitor Thulani wish to see me?”
      </p>
      <p>
        “1430, ninety minutes before the conference. You are invited to that as well.” Chaleron looked towards Naomi.
        “If your subordinate has any information she believes is worth voicing, I would also invite her to the
        questioning.” His gaze went right through her, and Naomi felt like her thoughts were being sifted through.
        Despite herself, she stood straight and looked back at him.
      </p>
      <p>“I would be honored to aid the God-Emperor’s servants as needed.”</p>
      <p>
        “I’m glad to hear it, Sister. I hope to see you both.” With that, the Interrogator turned and walked down the
        way he came, and both Sisters stared after him for a few seconds before Ruth started them walking again.
      </p>
      <p>
        “Come, I need to be dressed in something better than these robes if we are to see an Inquisitor. There’s no
        telling what we may be called to do in times like these.”
      </p>
      <p>Naomi hummed. “Should the rest of the squad be organized as well?”</p>
      <p>
        Ruth thought for a few seconds, evidently weighing the options. “Yes,” she said finally, “better that we all be
        ready. None of them were asked to come for questioning or the conference though, and none of our sisters have
        information that may help this investigation regardless. I have already inquired to that myself. But where
        Malleus strides—”
      </p>
      <p>
        “Horrors stir in its wake,” Naomi finished, knowing the common saying among the Ordo Hereticus Inquisitors they
        had both served under. “I do not doubt this squad or this Order, Superior.”
      </p>
      <p>“Nor do I, Sister. Let us not leave any doubts for Inquisitor Thulani.”</p>
      <p>
        Together they walked towards the temporary quarters, Ruth’vael issuing orders to suit up over the vox, and Naomi
        steeling her will for whatever may come. Tolav may be dead, but the Order of Our Blinded Lady would see to her
        survival.
