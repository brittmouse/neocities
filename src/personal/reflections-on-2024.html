      <h1>Reflections on 2024</h1>
      <time datetime="2024/12/26">December 26, 2024</time>
      <p>2024 has thrown a lot of shit. It's also thrown some good. On the whole I'm not too jazzed about how events
        have transpired.</p>
      <p>This has turned out a bit longer than I was anticipating, so I'll include a table of contents for you to use to
        hop around.</p>

      <h2 id="work">Work</h2>
      <p>This is my first time working a full calendar year since 2020, and it's been a test of endurance. While I enjoy
        much of my job, it's left me knowing this is not something I want to be stuck doing for another year.</p>
      <p>For context, I work at a used book store, and I make and manage the customized listing we post to eBay for
        speciality books, rare finds, older textbook editions, and lots of Kickstarter projects for some reason. While
        it nets a lot (and I mean a lot) in sales, it gets old after doing it for weeks on end, even considering my
        rather extensive notetaking system. Leave it to the GNU/Linux user to use Neovim daily for writing Markdown.</p>
      <p>I've thoroughly enjoyed my time there but I can't make a living doing it, and I especially can't afford an
        apartment on this sort of money. 2025 is going to be the year I look towards leveling up. I'm not sure which
        direction that goes though, whether that's going back to college or learning IT stuff or trying to make my way
        doing some writing for magazines and journals, something I've been quietly interested in for a while anyways.</p>

      <h2 id="tech">Technology and Linux</h2>
      <p>I started using Linux back in June or July 2023, and I have felt no compulsion to go back to Windows on any of
        my personal devices. Switching to Linux has been something I've very happy with, even if this year was my year
        of distrohopping. While not as extreme as others I've seen, I have used, across various devices:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Linux Mint</li>
          <li>EndeavourOS</li>
          <li>Arch Linux</li>
          <li>NixOS</li>
          <li>Fedora</li>
        </ul>
      <p>And that's not even counting the various virtual machines I've messed around with, including Pop!_OS and Debian.</p>
      <p>I'd like to think I feel stable enough with my choice of Linux distributions for the time being, as I'm really
        not interested in continuing to distrohop just to try out a package manager or whatever else. Sure, my IdeaPad
        needs to get an updated version of Linux Mint or at the very least have its data backed up so I can do either a
        proper upgrade or put Fedora or something on it, as that seems to be where I'm most comfortable with Linux
        distributions at this time. And yeah, I could put Fedora with Sway on my mini PC because I'm not that much of a
        fan of the Arch family of distros. But right now I just want stuff to work well.</p>
      <p>Besides, I have something new to experiment with. I've been looking into running a home server for a while
        &ndash; something for my family to host their own files away from big cloud storage providers like Google Drive,
        Onedrive, and Apple Cloud that are stealing everything in them to run LLM and image generation model trainings
        with no respect to copyright or due compensation. Is it strictly necessary? Probably not, as I don't really
        expect something like a local cloud to really be picked up on quickly, as neat as it would be. But a small
        computer can still do a lot even if it's not being used for a NAS. I could do things like run network-wide
        adblocking, set up a VPN so I can connect to the home network from anywhere as long as I have my own internet
        connection, set up a digital library for my dad and I who get lots of ebooks, run a game emulator like Dolphin
        for our old Wii games, or run a simple Minecraft server for my sister and I to share.</p>
      <p>Because of this, I asked for a decently strong mini PC to start with for Christmas. Surprisingly, they actually
        got it for me. It's a GMKtec Nucbox M5 Plus with an AMD Ryzen 5825U and integrated graphics. It's got dual 2.5Gb
        Ethernet ports, lots of USB ports, HDMI and DisplayPort output, and it's easier to disassemble than the
        Minisforum UM790 Pro that sits on my desk. You just pop the top off, unscrew four Philips head screws, and pop
        the fan cover off, and that gives you access to the internals.</p>
      <p>I got it barebones to save money and not have to waste time uninstalling a licensed copy of Windows 11 that I
        want nowhere near me. While writing this, I got a 1 TB Samsung 990 EVO Plus and 16 GB of RAM at DDR4-3200 from
        Corsair, and I barely managed to fit the entire cost onto the gift cards I got for my birthday and Christmas.
        I'm also undecided on what operating system to put on it. Like <em>obviously</em> it's going to be Linux, but
        what kind of Linux do I want to be running? So far the debate is between Proxmox, Ubuntu Server, and Fedora
        Server, but you'll hear much more about that as I catalog my experiences with setup similar to my ThinkPad
        articles.</p>
      <p>The services themselves are also something I'm looking into. While I've hardly decided what I want yet, I at
        least want a local remote for my Git repositories (these are largely creative writing and not software projects
        because I am a madwoman, but there are a couple software things I'd like to build out, like an HTTP server).
        That could be done using something like Gitea (although there's been some drama around that?), Forgejo (which is
        what Codeberg is built on), GitLab (which is apparently very heavy on system resource use), or a bare Git server
        following a guide in the ebooks I got from Humble Bundle. I also definitely want adblocking, likely a NAS of
        some sort, and a Minecraft server. This computer should be powerful enough to handle that.</p>
      <p>My tech experiences this year have been pretty great, which is more than I can say for the rest of the year,
        but I'm taking it.</p>

      <h2 id="rel-pol">Religion and Politics</h2>
      <p>I'm putting these together because of the overlap they have in my life as well as their impacts on my mental
        health. I'm not a very religious or spiritual person, having been strongly disillusioned with Christianity after
        seeing how terribly I was treated once I realized I was transgender. It was to the point where I confessed a
        little too much to my therapist on the day of my graduation and thus completely missed it as I got sent to a
        psych ward.</p>
      <p>I've been bouncing around for a while, dipping my toes into different things to see what makes sense to me.
        Paganism didn't really catch me, as I'm not a fan of the "manifest your better self" shit that seems to be all
        over the place. I certainly didn't want to go back to Christianity, and Islam is not something I've ever wanted
        to be part of. For a while I was antitheist, taking the socialist line of "organized religion of the opiate of
        the masses," something I do still generally agree with but hate seeing out and about because it is
        <em>always</em> the most annoying people saying that.</p>
      <p>And then October 7 happened.</p>

      <h3 id="palestine">Israel-Palestine</h3>
      <p>I haven't been on Israel's side for a while, as the racial discrimination and deeply weird expansionist
        settlers have given me more than enough reasons to oppose the Israeli government. That's not even getting into
        Tde Seiman. Directly after October 7, my heart broke for the 1200 dead that Hamas left in their wake and the 230
        hostages taken. It broke again and again with each Israeli airstrike that killed dozens or each IDF sniper that
        killed a Palestinian journalist. I've been angry about the war and the endless "oh we're really close to a
        ceasefire guys, trust me" lies from the Department of State. It's to the point that I can't even read Blinken's
        writing without wanting to scream at him for refusing to communicate in a way that actually gets information
        across to people instead of propaganda.</p>
      <p>What's pissed me off nearly as much were the student protests against it. I haven't gotten to a rally for
        either side of this conflict because radical Zionists (radical Zionism here meaning only a Jewish state should
        exist in the Land of Israel and not an Arab one) and Christian dominionists on Israel's side are repugnant
        people, and radical pro-Palestinian groups trend towards lionizing Hamas and legitimizing violence towards Jews
        with phrases like "globalize the Intifada."</p>
      <p>Neither of these radicals are people I'm willing to support, and I actually have more criticism and anger
        towards the radical pro-Palestinians for failing to properly understand the situation and just being intensely
        racist towards Jews at large. You can oppose apartheid and anti-Arab discrimination without getting into
        international banking consortiums or manipulative pro-Israel groups being the only reason Israel gets any
        support among Americans or saying antisemitism doesn't exist. I expect racists in the pro-Israel crowd to be
        racist. I expect evangelicals, especially Christian dominionists, to be racist towards Jews in their own
        "convert or die" approach to Armageddon. I expect self-avowed antiracists on the American Left to not be racist.
        That shouldn't be hard.</p>

      <h3 id="visit">The Visit</h3>
      <p>All that to say, the behavior of many pro-Palestinian groups got me more than a little interested in how well
        my local Jewish community was doing. After all, there are lots of synagogues both in and outside Atlanta. Why
        not pop in one day and see what it's like?</p>
      <p>One Saturday, the Saturday for Passover it turned out, I went looking for a temple nearby to visit. There was
        one just a few minutes from me. Better yet, it was a Reform synagogue, which would likely be easier for me as a
        non-Jew to understand because there's less Hebrew and more English. So I just got up and left, and I had one of
        the best experiences of the past year.</p>
      <p>The rabbi was a cool alternative guy who didn't really look like a rabbi but did look like a wise man. He led
        morning prayers on the floor, eschewing the dais raised above the congregation which had the podiums for the
        rabbi, cantor, candle lighting ceremony, and which housed the Ark that held the two Torah scrolls. He had a
        guitar with a shallow body in his hands and dressed pretty modestly, with a short-sleeved button up instead of a
        dress shirt.</p>
      <p>The congregation was all older folks, and while I have seen a few people around my age there, the regulars are
        a couple moms and the elderly. That wasn't really off-putting though, as I've been hanging around people older
        than me my entire life (don't take that out of context). The service itself was about an hour and a half, and
        I'm very glad I went to a Reform temple for my first visit because I didn't know a lick of Hebrew besides the
        stuff that's transcended the language barrier and made its way into English (words like Halleluyah).</p>
      <p>The siddur (prayer book) used is the Mishkan T'filah by the Central Conference of American Rabbis. I ended up
        buying the traveler's edition for myself, and I'm very happy the Conference made the decisions it did with the
        siddur. It has Hebrew (with vowel markings), English, and a transliteration so you can pronounce the Hebrew
        prayers and songs even without knowing Hebrew. I can't overstate how much that has helped me.</p>
      <p>They were super patient with me and answered a lot of the questions I had. I answered their questions about why
        I was there, saying I was there to learn for myself and not for a class (they get a lot of World Religions
        students) and I wasn't there to convert either. The prayers themselves are gorgeous, and since going I've been
        singing them in my own time. After the service, we all went out to the lobby and had lunch. We studied the
        annual cycle of the three pilgrimage festivals (Passover, Shavuot, and Sukkot) instead of some hokey teaching
        about God's love and Jesus' sacrifice that my pastors had never stopped talking about. Having a teaching about
        something that basic and grounded instead of the sort of grand, all-encompassing reach of Protestant teachings
        really kept my interest.</p>
      <p>It was in short the best experience I had in a religious place for a long time.</p>

      <h3 id="follow-up">Following Up</h3>
      <p>Since then, I've been going every couple of weeks to both Friday night and Saturday morning services, getting
        to know people and getting involved with the temple proper. I'm now one of three people who knows how to run the
        streams for services, and it's something I'm rather happy doing. While I don't get along with everyone, I've
        kept going because it feels like I need to for myself. I feel safer there than I did at a church despite the
        constant worry of some antisemite getting in that the police officer outside always represents. I'm learning,
        I'm laughing, and I'm able to be around people who want me to learn and grow.</p>
      <p>The first rabbi has left to lead a congregation a state over. We went months without a rabbi, but we did
        eventually find someone originally from New York living in the area to serve as a sort of interim rabbi for a
        few months. Having a gay rabbi has made me feel safer as a transgender woman, although it turned out the
        previous rabbi has a queer daughter, so I've always been more accepted there than I expect I would be at an
        Orthodox synagogue. It turns out that several of the Orthodox synagogues here are welcoming of gay members, but
        it's a bit dicier with respecting trans identities. They'll recognize it but only after gender-affirming
        surgery.</p>
      <p>I feel that my world has grown more by having a community of people I can actually turn to instead of just
        people on the other side of a screen (as much as I love all my long-distance friends). Come the new year, if I'm
        still going, I'll have to become a member and look for a place to convert, since our congregation can't really
        handle those at the moment. What's even better is that one of the temple regulars helped found our county's
        interfaith alliance. There is genuine good coming from this small group of Georgia Jews, and it is healing. I
        have to give back in my way and help repair the world.</p>

      <h3 id="politics">The Politics</h3>
      <p>This year has been deeply painful on many fronts. With Israel's continued bombardment of Palestine and Lebanon,
        the anti-incumbent wave pushing out democrats for authoritarian right-wing governments across Europe and
        America, and the brutal, soul-crushing hate expressed towards transgender Americans like myself, my mental
        health as suffered heavily. I can't think about starting HRT without worrying about providers and doctors being
        reliable or finding housing or anything else. It's an all-encompassing terror, and I'm stuck in it.</p>
      <p>While I have <a href="../politics/anti-trans-1.html">written</a> about these feelings and the need to carry on
        despite them, I haven't really gotten across how fucking weird everything feels now. Nothing feels right.
        Everyone's insane about drones in New Jersey until they aren't. Matt Gaetz can get called out for prostitution
        and illicit drug use and face no consequences, besides not being in the House, and he may be acting Senator for
        Florida in a few months anyways. Everyone is willing to believe in conspiracy theories at the drop of a hat,
        like how my mom thought it was "convenient" that Hurricanes Helene and Milton "hit red states right before an
        election."</p>
      <p>We're speeding headlong into an anti-intellectual dark age &ndash; a time of dumber, more hateful people
        running society. We must keep our heads and our hearts about ourselves, despite all attempts the wrest them from
        us. I won't pretend to be holier than thou, though. I'm a spiteful girl, and the curses I've thrown at every
        conservative politician may fit inside Job. Our humanity is going to get us through this, the good and the ugly.
        Don't lose hold of yourself or your loved ones. We will persist. If transgender people go extinct, it will be
        with humanity's broader extinction.</p>
      <p>Speaking of, we are running even more out of time on addressing the climate crisis. With conservatives taking
        over lots of governments, we may be out of time to prevent the absolute worst of it all. That doesn't mean the
        people in charge should be given a moment of rest though. Even if we're fucked, at least make the ruling class
        miserable.</p>

      <h4 id="mangione">Mangione</h4>
      <p>I've done my best to avoid reading or following up with the United Healthcare's alleged shooter, Luigi
        Mangione. The mass focus on the man has turned the crazy up on so many people I know that it feels like
        derangement. They are incapable of being normal about him. Everyone assumes he did it; I have <em>barely</em>
        heard the word "alleged" during discussions about him. People are either taking all the police evidence
        completely seriously or saying this is all a setup. Leftists are for some reason making him out to be a working
        class champion.</p>
      <p>The boring answer is to say this is an expression of mass lower-class anger towards the upper class finally
        exploding. I don't even think it's that wrong either. People <em>hate</em> healthcare companies and CEOs. They
        deserve all the hate that they get too. Their petulant whining to the New York state and city governments is
        pathetic, and Mayor Eric "I love Turks" Adams and Governor Kathy "I'm not a Cuomo I swear" Hochul bending over
        backyards to soothe the fears of these poor, sad multimillionaire losers is worthy of all the mockery it's
        gotten. I have absolutely no sympathy towards Brian Thompson, but I do feel slightly bad for his kids, just
        because getting your dad murked sucks even if he did deserve it.</p>
      <p>I am not going to be doing hero worship of Mangione though. First, he's only alleged to be the shooter. Second,
        I have better things to do with my time rather than attempt to emulate his behavior. The NYPD and feds have been
        way too weird about him for me to trust them whatsoever, and I would not complain if he got found not guilty via
        jury nullification or a violation of his rights as an accused. I just want people to stop being so damn weird
        about it.</p>

      <h2 id="to-2025">The Road Goes Ever On and On</h2>
      <p>Going into 2025, I am more anxious than anything. I am not looking forward to the next Trump administration, or
        the persecution of my friends and loved ones for no reason, or the further enshittification of everything. Hell,
        I asked for some clothes this Christmas and the ones I got just feel like worse quality than what I had just as
        a teenager. It's enraging, and things only look like they're going to get worse. The climate, international
        chaos, domestic strife, a lack of cultural anchors in mass media, and further anti-intellectual behaviors are
        all going to get worse.</p>
      <p>Even on the home front, I have to worry about healthcare (including normal healthcare and gender-affirming
        care), housing, a new job at some point, possibly further education, and so much else. But I've done things this
        year and can continue next year. I can go deeper into Judaism. I can learn more about Linux, networking, and
        system administration. I can DIY my HRT. I can find a way through this despite my fears and the obstacles
        arrayed against us. I do not intend to die in this state. I intend to die fulfilled and thriving, having given
        as much to the world as I can. I will leave it better than I found it.</p>
      <p>I'm going to get out there and volunteer next year. I've sat on my hands too long. It's past time for me to
        help repair the world.</p>
